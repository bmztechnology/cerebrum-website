# Endowment Model Yale Approach: Illiquidity

## I. Executive Summary

The **Endowment Model**, pioneered by David Swensen at Yale, revolutionized institutional investing by shifting away from the traditional 60/40 (Public Stock/Bond) portfolio towards **Alternative Assets** (Private Equity, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds, Real Assets). The core premise: Institutions with infinite time horizons should harvest the **Illiquidity Premium** that retail investors cannot access.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Philosophy)
1.  **Equity Orientation:** Bonds differ inflation. Stocks/Real Assets drive growth. Target 90% Equity-like risk.
2.  **Diversification:** Domestic Equities are efficient. Alts are inefficient. Find Alpha in inefficient markets.
3.  **Illiquidity:** Lock up capital for 10 years (PE). Earn outcome > Public Markets + 300bps.

### Definition 2.2 (The Allocations)
Typical Endowment:
-   Public Equity: 15% (Low).
-   Hedge Funds (Absolute Return): 25%.
-   Private Equity / VC: 35%.
-   Real Assets (Timber/Oil): 15%.
-   Bonds/Cash: 10%.
"radical" compared to typical pension.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Liquidity Transformation
Endowment: Liabilities = 5% spending rule per year.
Assets = Perpetual.
Mismatch? No, 5% is small.
Endowment can afford to be 80% illiquid.
Crisis (2008): Harvard/Yale liquidity crunch. Had to sell liquid assets (Stocks) at bottom to meet capital calls.
"Liquidity is a constraint, not a goal."

### 3.2 Unsmoothing
Private valuations are smoothed (Appraisal based).
Vol appears low. Sharpe appears high.
True volatility of VC is likely 50-100%.
Endowment model relies on not marking-to-market daily.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Manager Selection
The "Alpha" of the Endowment Model is 100% dependent on picking Top Quartile managers.
Dispersion between Top and Bottom VC funds is massive (20% vs -5%).
Public markets dispersion is low.
Access (Getting into Sequoia/Benchmark) is the key asset.

### 4.2 Democratization?
Can retail copy Yale?
Liquid Alts (ETFs).
Usually suffer from adverse selection (Buying what institutions are selling).
Yale model is hard to replicate without the Access and Scale.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Spending Rule):**
$Spending_t = 0.7 \times (Spending_{t-1} \times (1+\pi)) + 0.3 \times (MarketValue_t \times 5\%)$.
Tobin's Formula.
Smooths the budget against market volatility.

**Exercise 2 (Inflation Hedge):**
Timberland.
Real asset. Biological growth (Tree grows) is uncorrelated to markets.
Price of wood correlated to inflation.
Perfect endowment asset.
