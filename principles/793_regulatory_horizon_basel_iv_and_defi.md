# Regulatory Horizon Basel IV and DeFi

## I. Executive Summary

Regulation swings like a pendulum between **Deregulation** (Efficiency) and **Over-Regulation** (Stability). The current horizon includes **Basel IV** (Capital Constraints for Banks), **MiCA** (Crypto Regulation in EU), and the **SEC's crusade** against "Unregistered Securities." The microstructure impact is the migration of risk from regulated Banking to the **Shadow Banking** and **DeFi** sectors.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Basel III / IV)
Capital Adequacy Ratios.
Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).
Result: Banks cannot hold risky inventory.
Market Making desks shutdown.
Liquidity provision moves to HFT (Prop shops) and Private Credit.
Structure becomes "Agency" only.

### Definition 2.2 (MiCA - Markets in Crypto Assets)
EU Framework.
Regulates Stablecoins (Reserves enforcement).
Regulates CASPs (Crypto Asset Service Providers).
DeFi (Fully Decentralized) largely exempt?
"Decentralization Theatre" will be tested.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regulatory Arbitrage (Endgame)
If US bans Crypto, innovation moves to Asia/Middle East.
Capital is permissionless.
Regulators face a "Prisoner's Dilemma."
Cooperate (Global Ban) or Defect (Become a Hub).
Jurisdictional competition.

### 3.2 The Compliance Tax
Cost of Compliance > Alpha?
Small firms die.
Consolidation into oligopolies (JPM, Goldman, Citadel).
Barriers to entry rise.
Innovation slows.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 KYC/AML on Chain
Permissioned DeFi (Aave Arc).
Whitelisted addresses.
Institutional Liquidity requires compliance.
The bifurcation of "Dark DeFi" (Retail/Hacker) and "Lit DeFi" (Insto).

### 4.2 Code is Law vs Law is Law
Tornado Cash sanctions.
US Treasury sanctioned a Smart Contract (Code).
First time in history inanimate signals were sanctioned.
Clash between Free Speech (Code) and National Security.
