# Global Macro Allocation Framework: Top Down

## I. Executive Summary

**Global Macro** allocation views the world through the lens of Economies and Policies rather than Asset Classes. Returns are driven by two primary forces: **Growth** and **Inflation**. The "Holy Grail" is to forecast the **Rate of Change** of these forces relative to market expectations (Discounting). Bridgewater's **"Economic Machine"** framework is the archetype.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Four Quadrants)
1.  **Growth Rising, Inflation Rising:** Commodities, Emerging Markets, Corporate Credit.
2.  **Growth Rising, Inflation Falling:** Equities (Goldilocks), Developed Markets.
3.  **Growth Falling, Inflation Rising (Stagflation):** TIPS, Talk, Cash, Gold. (Hardest regime).
4.  **Growth Falling, Inflation Falling (Recession):** Nominal Gov Bonds.

### Definition 2.2 (Discounting Mechanism)
Assets price in *expected* future.
Prices move when *actual* data differs from *expected*.
Alpha = Forecasting the "Surprise."
"Beta" is holding the asset assuming equilibrium.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Policy Response
Central Banks and Governments manage the cycle.
Recession $\implies$ Rates Down / Stimulus $\implies$ Assets Up.
Overheating $\implies$ Rates Up / Tightening $\implies$ Assets Down.
The "Liquidity Cycle" leads the "Economic Cycle."

### 3.2 Capital Flows
Balance of Payments.
Real Rate Differentials.
Capital flows to high real yield / high growth.
FX trends drive asset returns in unhedged portfolios.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The 60/40 Problem
60/40 is optimized for Quadrant 2 (Growth Up, Inflation Down) and Quadrant 4 (Deflationary shock - Bonds hedge stocks).
It dies in Quadrant 3 (Stagflation). Both Stocks and Bonds fall.
Macro Allocators add Commodities/Breakevens to survive Q3.

### 4.2 Tactical Macro
Using PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) as a signal.
PMI > 50 and rising $\implies$ Overweight Equities.
PMI < 50 and falling $\implies$ Overweight Bonds.
Simple, effective regime filter.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Fed Put):**
Belief that Fed will stop Q4 (Deflationary Bust).
Short Volatility trade.
Macro view is a view on the Reaction Function of the central bank.

**Exercise 2 (Diversification via Geography):**
US and EU highly correlated.
China? Often counter-cyclical credit cycle.
True macro diversification requires disparate policy cycles.
