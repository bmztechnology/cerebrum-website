# The Repo Market Plumbing

## I. Executive Summary

**Repurchase Agreements (Repo)** are the plumbing of the financial system. It is how **Collateral** (Treasuries) turns into **Cash** and vice versa. It is the primary funding mechanism for **Shadow Banks** (Hedge Funds/Dealer Banks). A clog in the Repo market (September 2019) stops the heart of the market, forcing Central Bank intervention via **Standing Repo Facilities**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Repo Transaction)
Borrower (Hedge Fund) sells Treasury to Lender (MMF) for Cash.
Agrees to buy it back tomorrow at Price + Interest.
Economic equivalent: Secured Loan.
Legal form: Sale and Repurchase (Bankruptcy Remote).
Risk: Collateral Value drops (Haircut).

### Definition 2.2 (Rehypothecation - Velocity)
Churn.
Hedge Fund pledges Bond to Prime Broker.
Prime Broker pledges Bond to Money Market Fund.
One Bond supports multiple chains of IOUs.
"Collateral Multiplier."
If Chain breaks (Lehman), multiple parties are insolvent.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Gorton's "Slapped in the Face" Theory
Repo is "Information Insensitive" debt.
Lender treats it like cash because Collateral is safe.
Crisis happens when Collateral becomes "Information Sensitive" (Subprime).
Lender demands Haircut (from 0% to 40%).
Borrower cannot post margin.
Run on Repo.

### 3.2 The SLR Constraint
Supplementary Leverage Ratio.
Basel III rule.
Banks must hold capital against *all* assets (including Treasuries/Cash).
Makes low-margin Repo lending expensive for Banks (JPM/Citi).
Banks step back from Repo.
Liquidity dries up.
Regulatory unintended consequence $\implies$ 2019 Spike.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Basis Trade (Treasury-Futures)
Hedge Funds buy Treasury, Short Future.
Fund via Repo (0% equity, 100% debt).
Profit: Tiny spread.
Leverage: 50x.
Systemic Risk: If Repo rate spikes, trade blows up.
Fed forced to "Bail out the Basis" to save the Treasury market.

### 4.2 Reverse Repo (RRP)
Fed facility.
Money Market Funds lend cash to Fed (take Treasuries).
Floor for interest rates.
Absorbs excess liquidity ($2 Trillion in 2023).
Sterilizes QE.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (September 2019):**
Corporate Tax day + T-Bill settlement.
Cash shortage.
Repo rates spiked to 10%.
Fed intervened.
Showed the system operates with *zero* excess reserves buffer.

**Exercise 2 (Sponsored Repo):**
Expanding Repo access beyond Primary Dealers.
Clearing House (FICC) acting as central node.
