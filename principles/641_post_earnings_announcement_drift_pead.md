# Post Earnings Announcement Drift PEAD

## I. Executive Summary

**PEAD** is the tendency for a stock’s cumulative abnormal returns to drift in the direction of an earnings surprise for several weeks (or months) following the announcement. It violates the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which states prices should adjust instantly. PEAD persists due to **Cognitive Biases** (Anchoring) and **Structural Limits** (Analysts taking time to revise models).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (SUE - Standardized Unexpected Earnings)
$$ SUE = \frac{EPS_{actual} - EPS_{expected}}{\sigma_{EPS}} $$
Earnings Surprise.
High SUE Decile $\implies$ Positive Drift.
Low SUE Decile $\implies$ Negative Drift.
Strategy: Buy Decile 10, Short Decile 1.

### Definition 2.2 (Bernard & Thomas)
1989 Study.
Drift accounts for 50% of the total price move.
Initial reaction (Day 0) is incomplete.
Market under-reacts to the *persistence* of earnings. (Believes it's a one-off, but it's usually a trend).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Limited Attention
Hirshleifer.
If 10 companies report on the same day, PEAD is stronger.
Investors can't process all signals.
Distraction slows price discovery.
Friday announcements have stronger drift (Weekend inattention).

### 3.2 The Analyst Lag
Analysts are slow to upgrade.
"Career Risk" of being the outlier.
They revise estimates incrementally.
Price follows the slow revisions.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Earnings Momentum
Combine PEAD with Price Momentum.
"Fundamental Momentum."
Buy stocks that are moving up AND beating earnings.
High conviction signal.

### 4.2 Front-Running the 10-Q
The Earnings Press Release is Day 0.
The full 10-Q (SEC filing) comes days later.
Algos reading the 10-Q for hidden details (Margins, Footnotes) drive the secondary drift.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Revenue vs EPS Surprise):**
Revenue surprise is harder to manipulate than EPS (Buybacks/Accounting).
PEAD is stronger for Revenue Surprises.
"Quality" of the beat matters.

**Exercise 2 (Reversal):**
Does PEAD reverse?
Eventually.
But the drift lasts 60-90 days.
It is a medium-term anomaly.
