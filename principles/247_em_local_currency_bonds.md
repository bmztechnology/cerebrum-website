# EM Local Currency Bonds: The Evolution

## I. Executive Summary

Historically, EMs borrowed in Dollars (Hard Currency). Over the last 20 years, they developed **Local Currency Bond Markets**. Foreigners now buy bonds denominated in BRL, MXN, INR. This transfers the Exchange Rate Risk from the Sovereign (Original Sin) to the Foreign Investor. Indicated by the **GBI-EM (Global Bond Index - Emerging Markets)**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trade-off)
-   **Hard Currency Bond (EMBI):** Yield 6%. Risk: Default. (Spread over Treasuries).
-   **Local Currency Bond (GBI-EM):** Yield 12%. Risk: Default + Devaluation.
Investor takes FX risk for higher yield.

### Definition 2.2 (Real Yields)
To attract foreign capital into Local Bonds, EMs must offer high Real Yields (Nominal - Inflation).
Brazil Real Yield: $12\% - 5\% = 7\%$.
US Real Yield: $5\% - 3\% = 2\%$.
Spread = 5%. The "cushion" for FX volatility.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Market Deepening
Pension funds in Chile/Mexico/Poland are growing.
They buy local bonds.
This provides a "Domestic Floor" to the market.
Reduces volatility compared to "Tourist Capital" (Hot Money).

### 3.2 The Doom Loop (Local Version)
If Foreigners own 40% of Local Debt.
Panic $\to$ Foreigners Sell Bonds $\to$ Yields Rise + Currency Falls.
Currency Fall $\to$ Foreigners panic more (FX losses) $\to$ Sell more.
Feedback loop.
Central Bank must intervene in FX or buy bonds (QE).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Index Inclusion
When China/India bonds are added to JP Morgan GBI-EM Index.
Passive Funds *must* buy billions.
Yields compress. Currency strengthens.
Front-running index inclusion is a standard alpha strategy.

### 4.2 Hedged vs Unhedged
Buy Brazil Bond (12%).
Hedge BRL exposure (Cost 13%?).
Net Yield = -1%.
Usually, hedging destroys the yield (CIP).
You MUST take the FX risk to get the yield.
"The bond is a derivative on the currency."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Russia 2022 - OFZ):**
Foreigners owned 20% of OFZ (Local Bonds).
Sanctions $\to$ Capital Controls.
Foreigners trapped. Cannot sell.
Index Providers reduced Russia weight to Zero.
Write-down to zero.

**Exercise 2 (Duration Risk):**
EM Local Curves are steep.
Investors prefer Short Duration (2Y).
Long End (10Y) is risky (Inflation uncertainty).
Currencies with credible Central Banks (Mexico) have flatter curves.
