# Provenance on Blockchain

## I. Executive Summary

**Provenance** (the history of ownership) determines authenticity and value. Paper trails are forgeable (Beltracchi). **Blockchain** offers an immutable ledger for provenance. Whether tagging physical assets (NFC/DNA tags) or digital ones (NFTs), the "Chain of Title" reduces the **Due Diligence Discount** and eliminates counterfeiting risk in high-value commerce.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Phygital Twin)
Physical Object + Digital Token.
Link via NFC Chip (KONG, IYK).
Scan object $\implies$ Verify Token.
If Token doesn't match $\implies$ Fake.
Token burns on redemption? Or travels with object?

### Definition 2.2 (Mattereum Model)
Harding the link between Legal Rights and Token.
"Ricardian Contract."
Smart Contract points to Legal Contract (PDF) stored on IPFS.
Enforceable in UK Court.
Sold "The Asset Passport."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Oracle Problem (Physical)
Garbage In, Garbage Out.
If I tag a Fake bag as Real on the blockchain.
The blockchain immutably records the lie.
Trusted Authority (Authenticator) must sign the initial "Genesis" state.
Trust is shifted to the Edge (Entry point).

### 3.2 Dynamic Provenance
Carfax for assets.
Token records: Manufacturing date, Service history, Accident history.
Value of used car with "Full History" > Value of mystery car.
Information Assymetry reduction.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Supply Chain Traceability
Luxury Brands (LVMH - Aura Blockchain).
Track Louis Vuitton bag from Factory to Store to Customer.
Kills the "Super-fake" market?
Customer can verify authenticity with App.
Resale value maintained.

### 4.2 Blood Diamonds
Kimberley Process (Paper) vs Tracr (Blockchain).
Tracking diamond from Mine to Ring.
Ethical premium.
Conflict diamonds cannot enter the legitimate ledger.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Everledger Case):**
Identifying diamonds by laser scan of flaws.
Digital Fingerprint.
Hash the fingerprint to chain.
No physical tag needed (Diamond itself is the tag).
Robustness against swapping.

**Exercise 2 (Art Forgery Detection):**
AI analysis of brushstrokes.
Result hashed to chain.
If AI improves, re-run analysis.
Update the "Confidence Score" on chain.
Living provenance.
