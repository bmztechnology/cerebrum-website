# Fed Funds Market: Reserves

## I. Executive Summary

The **Federal Funds Market** is where Depository Institutions (Banks) lend **Reserves** (balances held at the Federal Reserve) to each other unsecured overnight. The weighted average rate is the **Effective Fed Funds Rate (EFFR)**, the central target of US Monetary Policy. Since QE created abundant reserves, activity has shifted from interbank lending to arbitrage by GSEs (Federal Home Loan Banks).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Corridor)
Fed controls rates via:
-   **Ceiling:** Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB).
-   **Floor:** Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP).
EFFR trades between them.
Currently, EFFR $\approx$ IORB - 7bps?
Depends on reserve scarcity.

### Definition 2.2 (GSE Arbitrage)
FHLBs cannot earn IORB.
They lend cash in Fed Funds market at rates $<$ IORB.
Banks (Foreign Banking Organizations - FBOs) borrow at Fed Funds rate, deposit at Fed (IORB).
Earn the spread (IOER - EFFR arbitrage).
This volume dominates the current market ($95\%+$).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Scarcity vs Abundance
-   **Pre-2008:** Scarce reserves. Fed adjusted supply daily via Open Market Operations to hit target. Active interbank market.
-   **Post-2008:** Abundant reserves (Ample Reserves Regime). Rate controlled by administered rates (IORB/ON RRP).
Volume in Fed Funds dropped significantly.

### 3.2 Sensitivity to QT
As Fed shrinks balance sheet (Quantitative Tightening), Reserves leave the system.
If Reserves get too low, EFFR spikes above IORB (September 2019 "Repo Spike").
Fed forcing dealers to borrow.
Signal to end QT.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 OIS Discounting
Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) reference Fed Funds.
OIS curve is the risk-free discount curve for collateralized derivatives.
Gold standard for valuation.

### 4.2 Bank Liquidity
Fed Funds borrowing is "Hot Money."
Sign of weakness if a bank relies on it heavily?
Not necessarily, FBO arbitrage is structural profit seeking.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fri-Mon Drop):**
Rates often drop on month-ends or holidays due to balance sheet window dressing.
Banks shrink balance sheet $\implies$ Stop borrowing $\implies$ Rate falls.

**Exercise 2 (Stigma):**
Discount Window (Primary Credit) is the backup.
Borrowing from Fed directly carries stigma.
Borrowing in Fed Funds market is anonymous (mostly).
