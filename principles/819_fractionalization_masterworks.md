# Fractionalization Masterworks and The DAO

## I. Executive Summary

**Fractionalization** breaks high-value assets (Picasso, Warhol) into tradable shares. This lowers the barrier to entry from \$10M to \$20. Platforms like **Masterworks** (Reg A+ Securities) or **PleasrDAO** (Crypto Tokens) act as the SPV manager. The microstructure challenge is the **Liquidity Mismatch**: Shares trade typically at a discount to Net Asset Value (NAV) until the physical painting is sold.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Reg A+ SPV)
Each painting is a company (LLC).
IPO the shares.
Platform takes Management Fee (1.5%) + Carry (20% of profit).
Hold period 3-10 years.
Exit: Sell painting to Private Collector. Distribute cash to shareholders.

### Definition 2.2 (The DAO Model)
PleasrDAO buys Wu-Tang Album.
Members engage in governance.
Token represents *membership*, not necessarily *equity* (Legal gray area).
"The Constitution DAO" effect: Crowdfunding signaled willingess to pay, driving price up against them.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Discount to NAV
Secondary market for fractional shares (Templum, Tzero).
Trading volume is low.
Shares trade at 30-50% discount to "Appraised Value."
Why?
1. Illiquidity.
2. Lack of control (Cannot force sale).
3. Fees drag.

### 3.2 The Democratization Fallacy
Does fractionalization increase the value of the underlying?
Yes, by adding "Retail Liquidity Premium."
If 1M people want to own a piece of Banksy, the aggregrate value of the pieces > whole.
"Sum of parts > Whole."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Arbitraging the Exit
Buy fractional shares at 50% discount on secondary.
Wait for Masterworks to sell the painting.
Realize Par value.
Risk: Hold period is uncertain. (IRR killer).

### 4.2 Segmented Liquidity
Blue Chip Art (Basquiat) vs Mid-Market.
Fractionalization only works for "Brand Name" art.
Nobody buys shares in unknown artists.
Concentrates liquidity in the winner-take-all bracket.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Bored Ape Split):**
ApeDAO.
Fractionalize 100 Bored Apes.
Issue APED token.
Token outperformed the floor price of Apes?
No, often trades at discount due to governance friction.

**Exercise 2 (Fee Drag Analysis):**
1.5% Mgmt Fee $\times$ 5 years = 7.5%.
20% Carry.
Gross Return 10% $\to$ Net Return to investor comes under pressure.
Must select high-momentum artists.
