# Robo Advisors and Digital Wealth

## I. Executive Summary

**Robo-Advisors** (Betterment, Wealthfront) automated Modern Portfolio Theory. By using algorithms to assess risk and allocate assets into low-cost ETFs, they democratized access to sophisticated strategies (Tax Loss Harvesting, Rebalancing) previously reserved for UHNW. This forced Fee Compression across the industry and pushed traditional incumbents to adopt **Hybrid Models**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Algorithm)
Input: Age, Income, Goal, Time Horizon.
Process: Map to Efficient Frontier (Mean-Variance Optimization).
Output: Portfolio Weights (e.g., 60% VTI, 40% BND).
Execution: API trading, fractional shares, auto-rebalance bands.

### Definition 2.2 (The Hybrid Model)
"Vanguard Personal Advisor Services."
Algo does the investing.
Human advisor does the planning/coaching.
Fee: 30bps (vs 100bps Traditional, 25bps Pure Robo).
The dominant winner in terms of AUM growth.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Commoditization of Asset Allocation
Asset Allocation is a solved problem (commodity).
Generating a 60/40 portfolio costs roughly 0 bps.
Why pay 1% for it?
Robos exposed this spread.
Value moved up the stack to "Planning" and "Complexity."

### 3.2 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs Life Time Value (LTV)
Robos have high CAC (Google Ads).
Low fees meant low LTV per client.
Struggle to be profitable standalone.
Pivot to B2B (Selling tech to banks) or getting acquired.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Gamification?
Robinhood is not a Robo (it's a brokerage).
Robos are anti-gamification.
Boring, steady, goal-based.
"Nudge" users to save more.

### 4.2 Integration
Linking Bank Account.
"Excess Cash Sweep."
Algo sees cash > target, sweeps it into investment account.
Holistic automation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fractional Shares):**
Allows \$500 portfolio to be perfectly diversified.
Prior to this, unit share prices prevented diversification for small accounts.

**Exercise 2 (Retirement Income):**
Robos great at accumulation.
Harder to automate "Decumulation" (Tax-efficient withdrawal strategy).
The next frontier for algorithmic advice.
