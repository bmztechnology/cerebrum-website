# Anatomy of a Bubble Euphoria

## I. Executive Summary

A **Bubble** characterizes a market condition where asset prices detach significantly from intrinsic value, driven by **Speculative Mania**, **Easy Credit**, and a **"New Era" Narrative**. Kindleberger's 5-stage model (Displacement, Boom, Euphoria, Distress, Panic) remains the definitive framework. Bubbles are typically rationalized by "This Time is Different" thinking.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Minsky Moment)
The point where the debt structure collapses.
Euphoria is funded by "Ponzi Finance" (Cash flow covers neither principal nor interest, relying on price appreciation).
When prices stall, the model breaks. Panic ensues.

### Definition 2.2 (Rational Bubble?)
Can a bubble be rational?
"Greater Fool Theory."
It is rational to buy an overvalued asset if you expect to sell it to someone else higher tomorrow.
Musical chairs logic.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Kindleberger's 5 Stages
1.  **Displacement:** New tech/shock (Internet, AI, Railroads).
2.  **Boom:** Credit creation fuels investment.
3.  **Euphoria:** Public retail participation. "New Era." Valuation metrics discarded.
4.  **Distress:** Insiders sell. Odds turn.
5.  **Panic:** Crash. Revulsion.

### 3.2 Feedback Loops
Price $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Collateral Value $\uparrow$ $\implies$ More Borrowing $\implies$ Price $\uparrow$.
Soros Reflexivity.
The bubble inflates itself until exogenous shock or exhaustion of credit.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Riding the Bubble
Soros: "When I see a bubble, I buy it."
Momentum strategy.
Bubbles can last longer than value investors can remain solvent.
Exit strategy is critical (Trailing stops).

### 4.2 The Short Squeeze
Bubbles are dangerous to short.
High sentiment + High short interest = Squeeze fuel (GameStop).
Directly shorting a bubble is a "Widowmaker" trade.
Put options define risk.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Shoe Shine Boy Indicator):**
Kennedy.
When outsiders (taxi drivers, shoe shine boys) give stock tips.
Maximum saturation. No marginal buyers left.
Signal to sell.

**Exercise 2 (Valuation Metrics):**
"Price to Clicks" (1999).
"Price to TAM" (2021).
Inventing new metrics to justify prices is the hallmark of Euphoria.
