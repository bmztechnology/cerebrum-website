# Universal Basic Income UBI Money Printing

## I. Executive Summary

**Universal Basic Income (UBI)** is a proposed solution to **AI Displacement** (Technological Unemployment). It involves the state distributing a fixed income to every citizen. The financing mechanism (Tax vs **Monetary Financing**) determines its economic impact. The synthesis links UBI to **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**: UBI is essentially "Quantitative Easing for the People" (Helicopter Money).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The AI Deflationary Force)
AI reduces cost of intelligence to zero.
Robotics reduces cost of labor to zero.
Massive Deflation.
Prices of goods collapse.
Wages collapse (Labor demand drops).
Spiral: No wages $\to$ No consumption $\to$ Economy dies.
UBI breaks the spiral by separating Income from Labor.

### Definition 2.2 (The Cantillon Effect vs UBI)
QE (Cantillon): Money enters via Banks $\to$ Asset Prices Rise $\to$ Rich get richer.
UBI: Money enters via Consumers $\to$ CPI Prices Rise (Bread/Milk) $\to$ Poor get inflation?
If Supply is infinite (Robots), Demand (UBI) doesn't cause inflation.
It just clears the market.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 MMT and the Job Guarantee
MMT prefers "Job Guarantee" over UBI.
Government as "Employer of Last Resort."
Keeps labor skills active.
Prevents social decay of idleness.
UBI critics: "Free money creates a useless class."
But if AI does *everything* better, what is the job?

### 3.2 The Sam Altman Thesis (Worldcoin)
"Moore's Law for Everything."
Tax Capital (Robots/Land). Redistribution to Humans.
Worldcoin: Proof of Personhood (Iris scan).
Distribute Global UBI via Crypto.
Separating the Monetary function from the State function.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the UBI Impulse
If UBI is implemented:
Short Luxury Goods? (Tax the rich).
Long Consumer Staples? (Mass consumption).
Long Automation Tech (The companies paying the tax/profit).
Inflation Hedge (Gold/Bitcoin) against the debasement required to fund it.

### 4.2 The Leisure Economy
If people don't work, what do they do?
Gaming, Metaverse, Entertainment, Travel.
"Attention Economy" stocks.
Experience Economy.
Long Roblox, Short ADP (Payroll processor).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Alaska Permanent Fund):**
Oil Wealth $\to$ Dividend to Citizens.
Popular. Durable.
Financed by Resource Rents, not Taxes.
Can "Data" be the new Oil? (Data Dividend).

**Exercise 2 (COVID Stimulus Checks):**
A trial run of UBI.
Result: Massive consumption boom + Supply Chain crunch $\to$ Inflation.
Lesson: Supply side must be elastic (AI/Robots) before UBI is safe.
