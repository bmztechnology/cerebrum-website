# Governance Arbitrage and Activism

## I. Executive Summary

**Governance Arbitrage** involves identifying companies with a **Value-Governance Gap**: good assets managed by bad boards. **Activist Investors** (Elliott, Engine No. 1) acquire stakes to force change (Board seats, Dividends, Spin-offs, ESG pivot). The microstructure involves **Proxy Plumbing** (Voting mechanics), **Wolf Packs** (Coordination), and **Universal Proxy Cards**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The 13D Filer)
Active stake (> 5%).
Intention to influence control.
"The Schedule 13D."
Market signal: "Company is in play."
Stock pops.
Activist captures the Alpha of their own intervention.

### Definition 2.2 (Universal Proxy)
Old Rule: Shareholders voting by mail could only pick form one slate (Management OR Dissident).
New Rule (2022): Universal Card lists *all* candidates. Mix and Match.
Increases Activist success rate (Easier to get 1-2 seats).
Microstructure shift favoring Dissidents.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Agency Problem
Management owns little stock. Maximizes salary/jets.
Shareholders own stock. Maximize value.
Activist aligns Management with Shareholders (by firing Management).
"Market for Corporate Control."

### 3.2 ESG Activism
Engine No. 1 vs Exxon.
Tiny fund (0.02% stake) won 3 board seats.
Argument: "You are destroying value by ignoring climate transition."
Linked ESG to Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).
Won support of BlackRock/Vanguard (The Passive Giants).
New paradigm: You don't need to own the company, just convince the Index Funds.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Wolf Pack
Multiple hedge funds buy < 5% stakes (No disclosure).
Coordinate tacitly.
Attack simultaneously.
Legal boundary: "Acting in concert" triggers "Group" disclosure rules.
Microstructure: High volume accumulation pre-announcement.

### 4.2 Empty Voting
Borrowing stock to vote.
Record Date capture.
Paying the borrow fee to control the outcome.
Decoupling Economic Interest from Voting Power.
Governance hack.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Poison Pill):**
Company defenses.
"Shareholder Rights Plan."
If Activist buys > 15%, all other shareholders get cheap shares.
Dilutes Activist instantly.
Forces Activist to negotiate instead of Hostile Takeover.

**Exercise 2 (Settlement):**
Activist demands 3 seats.
Company offers 1 seat + Buyback + "Standstill Agreement" (Don't criticize us for 1 year).
Activist accepts. Values pop.
Exit liquidity.
