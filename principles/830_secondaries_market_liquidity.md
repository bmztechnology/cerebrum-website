# The Secondaries Market Liquidity Discount

## I. Executive Summary

**Private Equity Secondaries** involve buying existing LP stakes in PE/VC funds. Historically a "Distressed Sale" market, it is now an active portfolio management tool. The key mechanic is the **Discount to NAV** (Net Asset Value). Buyers provide liquidity to LPs who need cash, capturing a spread and mitigating the **J-Curve** (buying mature assets).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (LP Interest Transfer)
Seller (Pension Fund) wants out of Blackstone Fund X (Year 7).
Buyer (Secondaries Fund e.g., Lexington) offers 85% of NAV.
GP must approve transfer.
Buyer steps into shoes of Seller (Assumes future Capital Calls).

### Definition 2.2 (GP-Led Secondaries)
Continuation Vehicle.
Fund is nearing end of life (10 years).
GP has a star asset they don't want to sell yet.
GP creates New Fund. Moves asset from Old Fund to New Fund.
LPs given choice: "Roll" or "Cash Out."
Conflict of interest: GP sets the price.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 J-Curve Mitigation
Primary PE Fund: Negative cash flow years 1-4.
Secondary Fund: Buy in Year 5.
Positive cash flow starts immediately (Distributions).
Higher IRR due to shorter duration.
Lower Multiple (MOIC) than Primary.

### 3.2 Pricing the Illiquidity
Why trade at a discount?
1. Uncertainty of NAV (Mark-to-Market lag).
2. Liquidity Premium (Cash now vs later).
3. Blind Pool risk (in LP interests).
During crises (2008, 2022), Discounts blow out to 30%+.
"Denominato effect": Stocks crash, Allocation to PE rises %-wise $\to$ Forced selling of PE to rebalance.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Mosaic Theory in Secondaries
Buyer owns stakes in 50 funds.
Sees data from portfolio company A in Fund X.
Use that data to price Fund Y (which holds competitor B).
Information advantage of the Fund-of-Funds model.

### 4.2 Tail-End Liquidation
Fund has 3 "Zombie" assets left.
GP wants to close fund.
Secondary buyer buys the "Tail" for pennies.
"Cleanup trade."

Buying access.

**Exercise 2 (Deferred Payments):**
Buyer pays 50% now, 50% in Year 2.
