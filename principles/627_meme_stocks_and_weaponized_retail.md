# Meme Stocks and Weaponized Retail

## I. Executive Summary

**Meme Stocks** (GameStop, AMC) represent the weaponization of **Retail flow** via social coordination (Reddit/WallStreetBets). By targeting **Illiquid** stocks with **High Short Interest**, retail swarms trigger **Gamma Squeezes** and **Short Squeezes**, overriding fundamental valuation. This phenomenon challenges the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** and highlights the power of **Narrative** and **Gamification**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Gamma Squeeze)
Retail buys OTM Call Options (cheap).
Market Makers sell calls $\implies$ Short Gamma.
Stock rises.
Market Makers must hedge by Buying Stock.
Buying drives price up $\implies$ More hedging buying.
Feedback loop.

### Definition 2.2 (Diamond Hands)
Behavioral commitment.
Refusal to sell despite volatility.
Reduces float.
Corners the market.
Collective action problem solved by social enforcement (posting "Loss Porn").

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Coordination Game
Alone, a retail trader is weak.
Together ($N=1,000,000$), they are a Whale.
Reddit acts as the Bloomberg Terminal for retail coordination.
Schelling Point: GME ticker.

### 3.2 Financial Nihilism
Why buy GME at \$400?
"To send a message." (Expressive Utilities).
"YOLO." (Skewness seeking).
Disconnect between price and cash flow.
The stock becomes a token of community membership (Like crypto).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Institutional Adaptation
Hedge funds now scrape Reddit.
"Retail Sentiment" factor.
Avoid shorting stocks with high social sentiment.
Or: Go Long with the mob (Front run).

### 4.2 The Pump and Dump?
Is it new? Or just a digital bucket shop?
Regulatory scrutiny (SEC).
The bagholder problem: The last person to hold strong ("Diamond Hands") loses everything.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Short Interest Ratio):**
GME had 140% Short Interest.
Mathematically impossible to cover without massive price spike.
Structural vulnerability exploited by the mob.

**Exercise 2 (Option Greeks):**
Retail learned Delta/Gamma.
Weaponized derivatives.
"Roaring Kitty" thesis was originally a fundamental value play + squeeze optionality.
