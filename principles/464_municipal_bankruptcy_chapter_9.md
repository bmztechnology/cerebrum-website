# Municipal Bankruptcy Chapter 9: Sovereignty

## I. Executive Summary

**Chapter 9** of the US Bankruptcy Code governs municipal bankruptcies. Unlike Chapter 11 (Corporate), the Court cannot interfere with the municipality's political or governmental powers (state sovereignty/10th Amendment). The Court cannot order tax hikes or asset sales. It can only approve or reject the **Plan of Adjustment**. Key tension: **Pensions vs Bonds**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Eligibility)
Does state law authorize filing? (Gatekeeper).
Many states (GA, IA) forbid cities from filing.
Must represent "Insolvency." "Good faith" negotiation failure.

### Definition 2.2 (Cramdown)
Court can confirm plan over objection of a class of creditors.
"Fair and Equitable" standard.
Does the plan discriminate unfairly?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Detroit Precedent (2013)
\$18B debt.
Emergency Manager appointed.
Proposal: Pensioners take cuts? Art Museum sold?
"Grand Bargain": Foundations/State put up money to save Art Museum and reduce Pension cuts.
Bondholders (Unsecured GO) took heavy haircut (74%).
Pensions took light haircut.
Established political hierarchy: Pension > Bond.

### 3.2 Stockton / San Bernardino (California)
CalPERS (Pension system) argued it is untouchable.
Cities cut bond debt but left pensions intact.
Bondholders argued "Unfair Discrimination."
Court approved plans anyway (Pensions are "humans," Bonds are "institutions").

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Special Revenues
Chapter 9, Section 928.
Revenue Bond liens survive bankruptcy filing.
Gross revenues usually safe.
General Obligation is the risk.

### 4.2 Statutory Liens
Post-Detroit, states (RI, CA) passed laws granting GO bonds a "Statutory Lien."
Moves them from Unsecured to Secured status.
Theoretically protects against Pension preference in future Chapter 9s.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Receivership):**
State takeover (without bankruptcy).
RI took over Central Falls. Paid bondholders first.
Prioritized market access over local services.
Opposite of Detroit.

**Exercise 2 (Holdout Risk):**
No voting aggregation in Chapter 9?
Plan confirmation requires majority vote.
Holdouts can be dragged along.
