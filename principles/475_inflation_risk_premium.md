# Inflation Risk Premium: Decomposing Yield

## I. Executive Summary

The **Breakeven Rate** is not a pure forecast of inflation. It is $Expected Inflation + Risk Premium$. The **Inflation Risk Premium (IRP)** is the compensation investors demand for the uncertainty of future inflation. Historically positive, it can turn negative (Deflation Risk Premium?) or surge during regimes of instability (1970s). Decomposing Nominal Yields into $r^*$ (Real), $\pi^e$ (Expected), and $\phi$ (Risk Prem) is the holy grail of macro analysis.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (DKW Model)
D'Amico, Kim, and Wei (Fed Model).
Affine Term Structure Model for TIPS and Nominals.
Extracts IRP term.
Often counter-intuitive results (IRP negative?).
Liquidity differential contamination.

### Definition 2.2 (Survey Data)
Use Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) as proxy for $E[\pi]$.
$IRP = Breakeven - Survey$.
Simple heuristic.
Usually shows IRP rising with maturity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Inflation as Insurance
If Inflation is Pro-Cyclical (Demand Pull):
Stocks/Economy Up $\implies$ Inflation Up.
Nominal Bonds Crash (Rates Up).
Stocks and Bonds Correlated (60/40 fails).
IRP should be **Positive**. Bonds are risky.

If Inflation is Counter-Cyclical (Supply Shock? or Deflationary Recession?):
Recession $\implies$ Inflation Down.
Nominal Bonds Rally.
Bonds are a Hedge.
IRP might be **Low**.

### 3.2 Term Premium
Nominal Term Premium = Real Term Premium + Inflation Risk Premium.
Recent decades: Term Premium collapsed. IRP compressed by Central Bank credibility (Anchoring).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Regime Change
If Fed tolerates higher inflation (Average Inflation Targeting).
Uncertainty rises.
IRP should expand.
Curve steepens (Long end demands higher premium).
Trade: Short Long-End Breakevens? No, Long Long-End Breakevens (betting on IRP widening).

### 4.2 TIPs vs Nominal Allocation
If $BEI < E[\pi]$ (Negative IRP/Liquidity prem).
Buy TIPS. It's "Cheap Insurance."
You get inflation protection for less than the expected cost of inflation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Vol Risk):**
Higher Inflation Volatility $\implies$ Higher IRP.
Market hates volatility.
Current regime (Post-2020) has high vol.
High IRP justified.

**Exercise 2 (Correlation Risk):**
If Bond-Stock correlation flips positive.
Bonds lose "Safe Haven" status.
Yields must rise to attract capital.
IRP is the mechanism.
