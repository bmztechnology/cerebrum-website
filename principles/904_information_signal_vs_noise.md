# Information Signal vs Noise

## I. Executive Summary

**Information** is the fuel of markets. But the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) has collapsed. We have **Infinite Data** but **Scarce Attention**. The Synthesis argues that Alpha has shifted from **Accessing Data** (1980s: Who has the quote terminal?) to **Filtering Data** (2020s: Who can ignore the tweet?). **Media Microstructure** (Clickbait/Algos) drives volatility.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Shannon Entropy in Finance)
$$ H(X) = - \sum p(x) \log p(x) $$
Market Surprise = Information.
If Fed hikes rates when everyone expected a hike, Information = 0. Price doesn't move.
If Fed cuts rates when everyone expected a hike, Information = High. Price jumps.
Price responds only to the *Unexpected*.

### Definition 2.2 (The Narrative Fallacy)
Taleb.
We force a story onto random data.
Market drops 1%. Headlines: "Market drops due to fears of... [Insert Random Event]."
Reality: Selling pressure > Buying pressure. (Noise).
Traders trade the Narrative, not the Fact.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Asymmetric Information (Akerlof)
Lemons Market.
Inside Management knows more than Outside Investors.
Result: Bad companies issue stock (knowing it's overvalued). Good companies don't.
Investors discount *all* issuance.
"Pecking Order Theory" (Cash first, Debt second, Equity last).

### 3.2 The Bloomberg Terminals Effect
Standardization of information.
Everyone sees the same headline at the same second.
Herding.
Correlated reaction.
Algorithmic reading of headlines (NLP) amplifies the speed of the herd.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Fading the News
"Buy the Rumor, Sell the News."
Rumor = Information Asymmetry (Edge).
News = Information Symmetry (No Edge).
Once it is on Bloomberg, it is in the price.
Fading the initial spike of a headline event.

### 4.2 Alternative Data
Satellite imagery of parking lots.
Credit card receipts.
Trying to restore Information Asymmetry.
The "Mosaic Theory" (Combining public info to form non-public insight).
Legal Alpha.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Fake Tweet):**
"Explosion at Pentagon" (AI image).
S&P 500 dropped 30 points in 2 minutes.
Recovered instantly.
Algos reacted to Signal. Humans verified it was Noise.
The dangerous gap between Algo Speed and Human Verification.

**Exercise 2 (Earnings Whisper):**
Consensus Estimate: \$1.00.
Whisper Number (Real expectation): \$1.10.
Company reports \$1.05.
"Beats Estimates!" (Headline).
Stock drops.
Why? Missed the Whisper.
Information is multilayered.
