# Self Attribution Bias

## I. Executive Summary

**Self-Attribution Bias** is the tendency to attribute **Success** to internal factors (Skill, Intelligence) and **Failure** to external factors (Bad Luck, Rigged Market). This asymmetry feeds **Overconfidence**: winners think they are geniuses, losers think they are victims. This prevents learning and leads to risk escalation after winning streaks.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Attribution Asymmetry)
$P(Success | Me) > P(Failure | Me)$.
"I picked the stock because I did the research." (Stock Up).
"The Fed manipulated the rates / The HFTs stopped me out." (Stock Down).
Protects Self-Esteem. Destroys Alpha.

### Definition 2.2 (The Hubris Cycle)
Win $\implies$ Self-Attribution (I am God) $\implies$ Overconfidence $\implies$ Larger Position Size $\implies$ Inevitable Mean Reversion $\implies$ Massive Loss.
Attributed to "Market Correction" (External).
Cycle repeats.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Cognitive Dissonance
Accepting "I am a bad trader" is painful.
Dissonance reduction: Blame the algo.
Rationalization preserves the ego's consistency.

### 3.2 Illusion of Skill
Kahneman.
Fund managers in large cap US equities.
Correlation of year-to-year rankings is ~0.
Suggests outcome is Luck.
Managers construct elaborate narratives to explain why it's Skill.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The "Luck" Ledger
Force yourself to attribute 50% of every win to Luck.
"I was long Beta in a Bull market."
"I got filled right before the tweet."
Keeping the ego small.

### 4.2 Analyzing Losers
The "Post-Mortem."
Force the question: "What did **I** do wrong?"
"I sized too big." "I moved the stop."
Internalizing failure is the only path to improvement.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Coin Amulet):**
Flip coin. If Heads, say "I made it land Heads."
If Tails, say "The wind blew it."
Sounds insane.
Traders do this every day.

**Exercise 2 (Team Dynamics):**
Portfolio Manager blames Analyst for bad pick.
Takes credit for good pick.
Toxic culture.
Best firms have "Collective Responsibility" or blind scoring.
