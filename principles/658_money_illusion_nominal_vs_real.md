# Money Illusion Nominal vs Real

## I. Executive Summary

**Money Illusion** (Fisher) is the cognitive bias where people think of money in **Nominal** terms (Face value) rather than **Real** terms (Purchasing power). This leads to irrational behavior during **Inflation** (feeling richer because wages rose 5% while ends rose 8%) and impacts asset pricing (stocks underperforming in high inflation because investors discount real cash flows with nominal rates).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Nominal Veil)
$Real = \frac{Nominal}{1 + Inflation}$.
If Salary $\uparrow$ 2% and Inflation = 4%, Real Salary $\downarrow$ 2%.
People cheer the 2% raise.
Surveys: People prefer a 2% cut with 0% inflation (Rational) less than a 5% raise with 10% inflation (Illusion).

### Definition 2.2 (Modigliani-Cohn Hypothesis)
Why stocks crash in inflation (1970s).
Rational: Inflation passes through to earnings ($Nominal Earnings \uparrow$).
Irrational: Investors use high *Nominal* bond yields to discount *Real* earnings.
Result: Massive undervaluation of equities.
"Waking up from the illusion" caused the 1980s Bull Market.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Anchoring
We anchor on the number printed on the bill.
A dollar is a dollar.
Psychologically, it is hard to continuously adjust the unit of account.
"Sticky Wages": Workers resist nominal pay cuts (morale disaster) but accept real pay cuts via inflation.

### 3.2 Housing Market
Housing prices are sticky downwards in nominal terms.
Sellers refuse to sell at a loss (Nominal).
In high inflation, real prices can drop 20% while nominal prices stay flat.
Inflation "greases the wheels" of the labor and housing market adjustments.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Asset Allocation
In high inflation, own Real Assets (Real Estate, Commodities).
Avoid Nominal Assets (Long Term Bonds, Cash).
Money Illusion causes the crowd to hold Cash ("I'm not losing money") while purchasing power evaporates.

### 4.2 Marketing Pricing
"Shrinkflation."
Keep price at \$4.99 (Nominal anchor).
Reduce size from 16oz to 14oz.
Consumers notice price changes more than volume changes.
Exploiting Money Illusion to maintain margins.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Raise):**
Boss offers 5% raise. Inflation is 7%.
Employee is happy.
Boss offers 0% raise. Inflation is 0%.
Employee is angry.
Rationally, the second offer is better.

**Exercise 2 (Stock Split):**
Apple splits 4-for-1.
Nominal price drops. Real value unchanged.
Demand spikes.
Illusion that "Stock is cheaper."
