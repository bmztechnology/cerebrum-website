# Growth Equity vs Buyout

## I. Executive Summary

**Growth Equity** sits between Venture Capital (Risk) and Buyout (Control). It targets **Proven Business Models** with high revenue growth but often negative or low cash flow. Unlike VC (Technology risk), Growth Equity takes **Execution Risk**. Unlike Buyout (Leverage), Growth Equity uses **Minority Stakes** and **Primary Capital** (money goes to balance sheet, not selling shareholders) to fuel expansion.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Rule of 40)
Valuation metric for SaaS/Growth.
$$ Growth Rate \% + Profit Margin \% \ge 40 $$
If Growth = 50% and Margin = -10%, Score = 40. (Investable).
Growth Equity investors optimize this balance.
LBO investors demand positive Margin.
VC investors demand max Growth (ignore Margin).

### Definition 2.2 (Primary vs Secondary Shares)
**VC/Growth:** Money buys *Primary* shares (New issuance). Cash enters company to hire sales/devs.
**Buyout:** Money buys *Secondary* shares (Old owners). Cash leaves company to ex-founders.
Growth Equity fuels the engine. Buyout changes the driver.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Governance Rights
Minority stake (10-30%).
Lack of Control.
Protection via Protective Provisions (Veto rights on debt, sale, IPO, budget).
"Board Observer" seats.
Softer influence than LBO dictators.

### 3.2 Unit Economics Analysis
Growth Equity does not bet on "Dreams."
It bets on $LTV/CAC > 3$.
"We know the machine works. We just need money to put more fuel in."
Scaling phase.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Crossover Fund
Hedge Funds (Tiger Global, Coatue) entering Growth Equity.
"Velocity of Capital."
Fast due diligence (2 weeks). High valuations.
Disrupted traditional Growth firms (GA, TCV) who took months.
Result: Valuation bubble in 2021. Crash in 2022.

### 4.2 Structured Equity
Downside protection in high valuations.
"Senior Participating Preferred."
Guaranteed 2x return before Common gets anything.
Allows investing at high headline valuation while reducing risk.
"Dirty Term Sheets."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The IPO Bridge):**
Invest in "Pre-IPO" round (Mezzanine).
Expected exit 18 months.
Arbitrage: Private valuation vs Public valuation.
Risk: IPO window closes (2022).
Growth Equity stuck holding illiquid bag.

**Exercise 2 (Buy and Build):**
Platform acquisition.
Growth Equity firm provides capital for M&A.
Hybrid of Roll-up (PE) and Growth.
