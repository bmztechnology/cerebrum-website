# Inflation vs Deflation Demographics vs Tech

## I. Executive Summary

The Great Debate: Are we entering an era of **Secular Inflation** (Deglobalization, Aging Population, Green Energy) or **Secular Deflation** (AI, Robotics, Debt Overhang)? The synthesis argues for **"Bflation"** (Bifurcation): Inflation in scarce Physical Goods (Food, Energy, Housing) and Deflation in Abundant Digital/Manufactured Goods (TVs, Software, Services).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Demographic Drag - Deflation)
Aging population (Japanification).
Old people save more, consume less.
Shrinking workforce $\to$ Lower Growth.
Theory: Aging is Deflationary.
Counter-Theory (Goodhart/Pradhan): Aging is Inflationary. Less workers $\to$ Higher Wages. More consumers (Retirees) relative to producers.

### Definition 2.2 (Technological Deflation)
Wright's Law. Costs drop exponentially with volume.
Software has zero marginal cost.
AI automates white-collar work.
Massive deflationary pressure on services (Legal, Medical, Coding).
Central Banks print money to fight this "Good Deflation," causing asset bubbles.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Lacy Hunt Thesis (Debt)
Debt > GDP $\implies$ Velocity of Money falls.
Every dollar of new debt generates $<\$1$ of GDP.
Diminishing returns.
Debt is inherently deflationary (must be serviced, reducing consumption).
Conclusion: Long Bond yields will go to zero.

### 3.2 The Regime Change Thesis (Possar)
War, Supply Chains breaking, Commodity Scarcity.
"Just in Time" $\to$ "Just in Case."
Labor Unions gaining power.
Greenflation (Cost of transition).
Structural Inflation floor of 3-4%.
The 40-year bond bull market is over.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The 60/40 Portfolio Death
Works if Stocks/Bonds are negatively correlated (Deflationary regime).
Fails if Stocks/Bonds are positively correlated (Inflationary regime).
2022: Both fell.
Need "Real Assets" (Commodities, Gold, TIPS) in the portfolio.

### 4.2 Pricing Power
In an inflationary world, only companies with Pricing Power survive.
Brand (Luxury).
Monopoly (Tech).
Essential (Utilities).
Companies with low margins get crushed by input costs.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Japan Trap):**
High Debt + Aging.
30 years of no inflation.
Yield Control.
Is Japan the future of the West?
Or an outlier because they export capital?

**Exercise 2 (The AI Shock):**
If AI does 50% of work.
GDP explodes. Prices collapse.
Monetary Policy framework (Targeting 2% inflation) becomes obsolete.
How do you measure inflation when quality improves infinitely?
