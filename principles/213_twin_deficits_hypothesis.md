# Twin Deficits Hypothesis: The Double Drain

## I. Executive Summary

The **Twin Deficits Hypothesis** states that a government running a large **Fiscal Deficit** (Spending > Tax) will typically also run a large **Current Account Deficit** (Imports > Exports). The logic: Fiscal Stimulus boosts aggregate demand, leading to more imports. To fund the gap, the country must import foreign capital. This makes the currency vulnerable to a "Sudden Stop" of capital flows.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Accounting Identity)
$$ (S - I) + (T - G) = (X - M) $$
Rearranging:
$$ (X - M) = (S - I) + (T - G) $$
If $S=I$ (Private savings utilized), then:
$$ CA \approx -FiscalDeficit $$
A Fiscal Deficit ($T-G < 0$) mathematically drags the Current Account ($X-M$) negative.

### Definition 2.2 (The Funding Mechanism)
How do you pay for the extra imports?
By selling Assets (Bonds/Stocks) to foreigners.
Foreigners buy Treasuries.
The Capital Account Surplus offsets the Current Account Deficit.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Reagan Era (1980s)
Tax Cuts (Fiscal Deficit $\uparrow$).
Rates High.
Dollar Strong (Capital Inflow).
Exports Crushed (Dollar too strong).
Current Account Deficit Exploded.
Result: Twin Deficits.

### 3.2 Emerging Market Crisis
For US, Twin Deficits are manageable (World Reserve Currency).
For EM (Turkey, South Africa):
Fiscal Deficit $\to$ Import Boom $\to$ CA Deficit.
Foreigners lose confidence. Stop buying bonds.
Currency Crash.
Twin Deficits are the best predictor of EM Currency Crises.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sensitivity Analysis
Trade: Short Currency of Twin Deficit nations.
Filter: Net International Investment Position (NIIP).
If NIIP is largely negative (They owe the world money) AND Twin Deficits are widening $\to$ Crisis is imminent.

### 4.2 The Correction
How does it fix itself?
Currency Devaluation.
Weaker currency $\to$ Exports Cheap / Imports Expensive $\to$ CA improves.
The market enforces the correction via devaluation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (US 2020s):**
Huge Fiscal Deficit (6% GDP).
CA Deficit (3% GDP).
Dollar crashed? No.
Why? "Global Savings Glut." World *wants* to buy US Tech/Bonds.
US "Exorbitant Privilege" breaks the standard Twin Deficit doom loop.

**Exercise 2 (Germany):**
Fiscal Surplus + CA Surplus.
Twin Surplus.
Germany exports capital to the rest of Europe.
Creates imbalances in the Eurozone (Target2 balances).
