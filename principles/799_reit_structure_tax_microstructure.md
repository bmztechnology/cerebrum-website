# REIT Structure and Tax Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

**Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)** allow liquid, fractional ownership of real estate. The core microstructure feature is the **Tax Pass-Through**: REITs pay 0% corporate tax if they distribute 90% of taxable income as dividends. This creates a unique **Capital Recycling** dynamic—REITs cannot retain earnings to grow; they must constantly issue new Equity/Debt to acquire properties.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The REIT Tests)
To qualify (internal code 856):
1.  **Asset Test:** 75% of assets in Real Estate/Cash.
2.  **Income Test:** 75% of income from Rents/Mortgages.
3.  **Distribution Test:** 90% of taxable income paid out.
4.  **Ownership Test:** No 5/50 Rule (5 people own > 50%).

### Definition 2.2 (Funds from Operations - FFO)
Gap vs Non-GAAP.
Net Income forces massive Depreciation (Non-cash charge).
REITs look unprofitable on P/E basis.
$FFO = Net Income + Depreciation - Gains on Sales$.
$AFFO$ (Adjusted) = FFO - Maintenance Capex.
AFFO is the "Free Cash Flow" for dividends.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 NAV vs Price
**NAV (Net Asset Value):** Private market value of the buildings (Appraised).
**Price:** Public market stock price.
**Premium:** Price > NAV. (Cost of Capital advantage. Issue equity to buy private buildings. Accretive).
**Discount:** Price < NAV. (Market fears. Buy back shares. Or get acquired by Private Equity).

### 3.2 The Agency Problem
Externally Managed REITs vs Internally Managed.
**External:** Advisor takes fees based on AUM. Incentive to grow empire regardless of shareholder value.
**Internal:** Management employed by REIT. Better alignment.
Microstructure trade: Long Internal / Short External.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 UPREIT Structure
Umbrella Partnership.
Property owner contributes building to Operating Partnership (OP) in exchange for OP Units (not Cash).
Tax Deferred transaction (1031 Exchange logic).
OP units convertible to REIT shares later.
Critical for acquiring family-owned real estate.

### 4.2 Sector Rotation
Apartments (Short lease, inflation hedge).
Office (Long lease, business cycle risk).
Data Centers (Tech growth, power constraints).
Towers (5G rollout).
Trading the underlying macro through sector selection.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Dividend Yield Trap):**
Mortgage REITs (mREITs) yield 12%.
Equity REITs yield 4%.
mREITs are leveraged bond funds (buy MBS, lever 10x). Risk is Interest Rates.
eREITs are landlords. Risk is Vacancy.
Difference in risk profile is massive.

**Exercise 2 (Triple Net Lease - NNN):**
Tenant pays Rent + Tax + Insurance + Maintenance.
REIT is purely a capital provider.
Bond-like cash flow.
O (Realty Income) model.
