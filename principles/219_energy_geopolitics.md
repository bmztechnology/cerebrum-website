# Energy Geopolitics: The Flow of Power

## I. Executive Summary

**Energy Geopolitics** studies how oil and gas flows dictate international relations. Energy Security > Economic Efficiency. Concepts include the **OPEC Cartel model**, **Pipeline Politics** (Nord Stream), and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The transition to Green Energy is shifting power from Petro-states (Russia, Saudi) to Electro-states (China - Rare Earths).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (OPEC Swing Producer)
Saudi Arabia.
Low marginal cost ($10/bbl). Massive spare capacity.
Function: Cut production to raise price (Defend Floor). Flood market to kill competitors (Defend Share).
2014 Price War: Saudi flooded market to kill US Shale.

### Definition 2.2 (Choke Points)
Strait of Hormuz (30% of global seaborne oil).
Malacca Strait (China's lifeline).
Naval dominance of these points ensures Hegemony.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Resource Curse (Dutch Disease)
Discovering oil $\to$ Currency appreciates $\to$ Manufacturing exports become uncompetitive $\to$ Non-oil economy dies.
Country becomes solely dependent on Oil Price.
Venezuela Case Study.

### 3.2 LNG Arbitrage
Natural Gas was regional (Pipelines).
LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) makes it global.
Price arbitrage: Asian JKM vs European TTF vs US Henry Hub.
US has become the "Swing Supplier" of gas to Europe via LNG.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve)
US has ~700M barrels in salt caverns.
Biden released 180M barrels in 2022 to fight inflation.
This acted as a "Short Oil" position.
Now US must refill (Put floor under price).

### 4.2 Energy-Inflation Correlation
Oil is input to everything (Transport, Plastics, Fertilizer).
Oil spike $\to$ Headline Inflation spike $\to$ Fed Hikes.
Oil crash $\to$ Disinflation.
WTI Crude is the most important chart for a Macro Trader.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Nord Stream):**
Germany relied on cheap Russian gas for industrial competitiveness.
Pipeline blown up (Sabotage).
Germany lost its "Business Model."
Basf (Chemical giant) moving to China/US.
Energy determines Industrial location.

**Exercise 2 (Petrodollar):**
1974 Deal: US protects Saudi $\leftrightarrow$ Saudi prices oil in Dollars.
Result: Global demand for USD.
If Saudi accepts Yuan (Petroyuan), USD demand falls.
