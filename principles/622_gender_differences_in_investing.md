# Gender Differences in Investing

## I. Executive Summary

Behavioral finance research reveals distinct **Gender Differences** in investing. Men tend to be **Overconfident**, trade more frequently, and hold riskier, less diversified portfolios. Women tend to be more **Risk Averse** (or Risk Aware), trade less, and adhere to plans. Consequently, women often achieve higher **Risk-Adjusted Returns** over the long term, debunking the myth that trading is a male skill.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Barber & Odean Spread)
Study of 35,000 households (1991-1997).
Men traded 45% more than women.
Trading reduced men's net returns by 2.65% per year.
Trading reduced women's net returns by 1.72% per year.
Difference driven by transaction costs of overtrading.

### Definition 2.2 (Risk Tolerance Gap)

### 3.2 Information Processing
Men: "Selectivity Hypothesis." Focus on heuristics/gist. Quick decisions.
Women: "Comprehensive Processing." Look at more details/context. Slower decisions.
Markets reward the comprehensive approach in the long run ("Due Diligence").

Industry historically ignored them or patronized them.
Opportunity for "Goal Based" rather than "Alpha Based" messaging.
