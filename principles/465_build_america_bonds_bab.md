# Build America Bonds BAB: Taxable Subsidy

## I. Executive Summary

**Build America Bonds (BABs)** were a temporary program (2009-2010 Recovery Act) allowing municipalities to issue **Taxable Bonds** with a Federal Subsidy (35% of interest). This opened the Muni market to Global Investors (Pensions, Sovereigns) who do not benefit from tax exemption. Though issuance ceased in 2010, the \$180B outstanding remains a key asset class.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Direct Pay vs Tax Credit)
-   **Direct Pay:** Treasury sends check to Issuer for 35% of coupon. Issuer pays 100% coupon to Investor. (Most common).
-   **Tax Credit:** Investor receives tax credit. (Rare).

### Definition 2.2 (Sequestration)
2013 Budget cuts.
Federal Gov reduced the subsidy payments (e.g., cut by 5.7%).
covenant breach?
Issuers had to make up the difference? Or passed loss to investors?
Many BABs had "Extraordinary Redemption" calls triggered by subsidy cut.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Market Efficiency
Tax-Exempt market is inefficient (Retail dominance).
Taxable market (Global) is efficient.
BABs allowed Munis to borrow cheaper than Tax-Exempts (even after grossing up).
Arbitrage of the "Muni-Treasury Ratio."

### 3.2 Liability Management
Calls at Par (Extraordinary) vs Make-Whole Calls.
Issuers exercised calls when Sequestration hit.
Investors lost high-yielding assets.
Litigation on "Materiality" of safeguard cuts.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 taxable Munis (Post-BAB)
Issuers still issue Taxable Munis.
Why?
1. Advance Refunding (Tax reform 2017 banned tax-exempt advance refunding).
2. Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs) are taxable.
3. Access to global liquidity (Asia/Europe buyers).

### 4.2 Credit Analysis
BAB = GO or Revenue Bond. Same credit risk.
Just different tax wrapper.
Often trade at spread to Corporate Bonds of same rating?
Yes, liquidity premium (smaller market).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Comparison):**
Muni Yield 3%. Taxable Equivalent 4.7%.
BAB Yield 5.5% (Spread to Treasuries + Credit).
BAB yields > TEY.
Why? Market segmentation.

**Exercise 2 (The Cliff):**
BAB program ended 2010.
Infrastructure proposals often suggest reviving it ("Direct Pay Bonds").
Efficient way to subsidize infrastructure.
