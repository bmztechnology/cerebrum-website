# Ethics in Finance Fiduciary Duty

## I. Executive Summary

**Ethics** in finance is not just moralizing; it is the **Lubricant of Trust**. Without trust (contract enforcement), transaction costs skyrocket. **Fiduciary Duty** is the legal obligation to act in the *client's* best interest. Conflicts of interest (Principal-Agent) erode this. The synthesis argues that "Long-Term Greedy" (Goldman Sachs) means being Ethical, because reputation is the ultimate asset.
