# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): Long-Term Valuation

## I. Executive Summary

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is an economic theory that states that in the absence of transaction costs and trade barriers, identical goods should have the same price in different countries when expressed in a common currency. It forms the basis of the "Law of One Price." In Forex, PPP is the primary model for determining the long-term "Fair Value" of an exchange rate, acting as a gravitational anchor for price over multi-year horizons.

## II. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Law of One Price
Let $P_{dom}$ be the price of a good in the domestic country (e.g., USA).
Let $P_{for}$ be the price of the same good in the foreign country (e.g., Eurozone).
Let $E$ be the exchange rate (Domestic/Foreign).

$$P_{dom} = E \times P_{for}$$

Therefore, the theoretical exchange rate $E_{PPP}$ is:
$$E_{PPP} = \frac{P_{dom}}{P_{for}}$$

### 2.2 Absolute PPP vs Relative PPP
-   **Absolute PPP:** compares the absolute price levels of a basket of goods (CPI).
-   **Relative PPP:** Accounts for inflation differentials. It states that the rate of depreciation of a currency should accept the difference in inflation rates ($i$).
    $$\frac{\Delta E}{E} \approx i_{dom} - i_{for}$$

## III. The Big Mac Index

Created by *The Economist* in 1986, this is a simplified, tangible example of PPP.
-   **Basket:** One McDonald's Big Mac.
-   **Calculation:**
    -   Price in US: $5.00
    -   Price in Eurozone: €4.00
    -   Implied Rates: $5.00 / 4.00 = 1.25$
    -   Actual Rate: $1.10$
    -   **Conclusion:** The Euro is undervalued by $(1.10 - 1.25)/1.25 = -12\%$.

## IV. Limitations of PPP

### 4.1 The Balassa-Samuelson Effect
Developed countries with high productivity in tradable sectors will have higher wages, driving up prices in non-tradable sectors (services, haircuts). Thus, rich countries always appear "overvalued" by PPP compared to poor countries, but this is a structural, not monetary, phenomenon.

### 4.2 Transaction Costs & Barriers
Tariffs, shipping costs, and varying taxes (VAT) prevent perfect arbitrage of goods.

### 4.3 Capital Flows
In the short to medium term (1-5 years), exchange rates are driven by Capital Flows (interest rate differentials, speculation), not Trade Flows (goods arbitrage). PPP only asserts dominance over very long horizons (10+ years).

## V. Strategic Applications

### 5.1 Long-Term Position Taking
Institutional macro funds use PPP to determine structural bias.
-   If PPP(EUR/USD) = 1.30 and Spot = 1.05: The Euro is fundamentally cheap.
-   **Strategy:** Accumulate Long positions on dips, expecting a multi-year reversion. Do not Short.

### 5.2 Mean Reversion Models
Quant funds use the deviation from PPP as a signal.
$$Z = \frac{Spot - E_{PPP}}{\sigma}$$
If $Z > 2$ (Overvaluation), short the currency to hedge portfolio risk.

## VI. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Relative PPP Calculation):**
Inflation in the US is 2%. Inflation in Turkey is 50%. The current USD/TRY rate is 20.00.
According to Relative PPP, what should the exchange rate be in 1 year to maintain parity?
$$E_{future} = E_{spot} \times \frac{1 + i_{dom}}{1 + i_{for}}$$
(Note: Be careful which is home/foreign).

**Exercise 2 (Arbitrage):**
Gold trades at $2000/oz in NY and €1800/oz in London. The EUR/USD rate is 1.05.
a) Convert the London price to USD.
b) Is there an arbitrage opportunity? How would you execute it (Buy X, Sell Y)?
c) How would your action affect the EUR/USD exchange rate?

**Exercise 3 (Critique):**
Why does the Japanese Yen (JPY) consistently trade away from its PPP value for decades? (Hint: Consider the Carry Trade and Japan's savings surplus).
