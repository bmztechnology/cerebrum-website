# Uranium Fuel Cycle: The Nuclear Renaissance

## I. Executive Summary

**Uranium ($U_3O_8$)** markets are unique: demand is totally inelastic (Nuclear plants run 24/7 regardless of price), supply is concentrated (Kazakhstan/Canada), and the fuel cycle is long (18-24 months from mine to reactor). After a "Lost Decade" post-Fukushima, the sector is in a structural deficit due to the revival of nuclear energy as a baseload green source.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Cycle)
1.  **Mining:** Ore $\to$ Yellowcake ($U_3O_8$).
2.  **Conversion:** $U_3O_8 \to UF_6$ (Gas).
3.  **Enrichment:** $UF_6 \to$ Enriched $UF_6$ (SWU - Separative Work Units). Increases U-235 isotope.
4.  **Fuel Fabrication:** Rods.
Bottlenecks can occur at any stage. (Currently Conversion/Enrichment squeeze due to Russia sanctions).

### Definition 2.2 (Secondary Supply)
Historically, the market was supplied by dismantling nuclear warheads ("Megatons to Megawatts").
This inventory is gone.
Now reliant on Primary Mine Supply.
$Mine Supply < Reactor Demand$.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Term vs Spot Market
Utilities (Utilities companies) buy 90% of uranium on Long Term Contracts (5-10 years).
Spot market is thin.
When Utilities panic-buy to secure contracted supply, Spot price spikes to signal miners to open.
Incentive Price for new mines $\approx $80-$90/lb.

### 3.2 Underfeeding vs Overfeeding
Enrichers can vary the amount of Uranium Feed.
-   **Underfeeding:** Use less U, more Energy (SWU). Creates secondary U supply.
-   **Overfeeding:** Use more U, less Energy. Absorbs U supply.
With Russia (40% of Enlightenment) sanctioned, Western enrichers maximize capacity (Overfeeding).
Massive Swing Demand for $U_3O_8$.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 SPUT (Sprott Physical Uranium Trust)
New vehicle. Buys physical Uranium and sequesters it.
Cornering the spot market.
Like a "Central Bank of Uranium."
Forces utilities to compete with investors for pounds.
Catalyst for the Bull Market.

### 4.2 SMRs (Small Modular Reactors)
Future demand.
Requires HALEU (High Assay Low Enriched Uranium).
Currently only Russia makes HALEU.
Supply chain crisis for the next generation of nuclear.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Kazatomprom):**
Kazakhstan produces 40% of world supply.
State-owned.
If geopolitical unrest hits Kazakhstan (e.g., 2022 riots), global nuclear fuel stops.
Supply concentration risk > Oil.

**Exercise 2 (Cameco Strategy):**
Cameco (Western Major) shut down its biggest mine (McArthur River) for years to starve the market.
Discipline.
Now reopening into high prices.
Oligopoly behavior.
