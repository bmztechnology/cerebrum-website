# Regulatory Arbitrage Geography and Class

## I. Executive Summary

**Regulatory Arbitrage** is the practice of structuring transactions to avoid strict regulations in one jurisdiction or asset class. Firms move capital to **Offshore Havens**, reclassify employees as **Contractors**, or label securities as **Utility Tokens** (Crypto). It exploits the inconsistencies between rules (SEC vs CFTC, US vs Cayman) to maximize profit/leverage at the expense of systemic risk.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Jurisdictional Arb)
US Leverage Limit: 2x (Reg T).
Bahamas Leverage Limit: 100x.
Trader opens account in Bahamas (FTX).
Capital flows to least regulated node.
"Race to the Bottom."

### Definition 2.2 (Wrapper Arb)
ETF vs Mutual Fund.
ETFs have tax advantages (Creation/Redemption avoids capital gains).
Hedge Funds trade via "Total Return Swaps" to avoid Stamp Duty (UK).
Same economic exposure, different legal wrapper $\implies$ Different Tax/Reg treatment.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Shadow Banking System
Banks are regulated (Basel III).
Hedge Funds/PE in "Shadow" are less regulated.
Credit risk moves from Banks to Shadow.
Systemic risk is conserved, just hidden.
2008 Crisis: SIVs (Structured Investment Vehicles) were Reg Arb devices.

### 3.2 Crypto as Reg Arb
Is it a Security (SEC)? Or Commodity (CFTC)?
XPR Lawsuit.
If Commodity $\implies$ Less disclosure.
The entire ICO boom was Securities Reg Arb (Selling equity without IPO protections).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Payment for Order Flow (PFOF)
Banned in UK/Australia.
Allowed in US.
Robinhood operates in US.
Global brokers route distinct flow to distinct entities.

### 4.2 Tax Inversions
US Company merges with Irish company.
Moves HQ to Ireland (Low Tax).
Operations remain in US.
Political risk: Laws change to close loopholes.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (CFDs in US):**
Contracts for Difference (CFD) illegal in US.
US Traders use "tastyworks" or Offshore.
Regulator blocks IP addresses.
The game of Cat and Mouse.

**Exercise 2 (The reverse merger):**
SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company).
IPO shortcut.
Less scrutiny than traditional IPO?
Reg Arb on the "Going Public" process.
SEC clamped down in 2021.
