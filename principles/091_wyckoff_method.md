# The Wyckoff Method: The Composite Man

## I. Executive Summary

Richard D. Wyckoff (1930s) proposed that the market should be viewed as if it were controlled by a single entity: "The Composite Man." This entity manipulates price to accumulate positions from weak hands (Retail) and distribute them to eager latecomers. The method provides a schematic for identifying the phases of the market cycle: Accumulation, Markup, Distribution, and Markdown.

## II. Formal Definitions

### 2.1 The Cycle Phases
1.  **Accumulation:** The Composite Man buys assets quietly within a range.
2.  **Markup:** The Breakout. Public participation begins.
3.  **Distribution:** The Composite Man sells assets to the public near the top.
4.  **Markdown:** The Crash.

### 2.2 Key Events
-   **PS (Preliminary Support):** First halt of a downtrend.
-   **SC (Selling Climax):** Panic selling. High volume. The low.
-   **AR (Automatic Rally):** Relief bounce. Defines the top of the range.
-   **ST (Secondary Test):** Revisit of the SC low.
-   **Spring (Shakeout):** Price dips below Support to clear stops.
-   **LPS (Last Point of Support):** Higher Low pivot before breakout.
-   **SOS (Sign of Strength):** Breakout of Resistance.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Three Laws
1.  **Supply and Demand:** Price moves to equilibrium. Excess Demand $\to$ Up.
2.  **Cause and Effect:** The "Cause" is the time spent in the range (Accumulation). The "Effect" is the distance of the trend.
    $$Effect \propto Cause$$
3.  **Effort vs Result:**
    -   *Bullish:* High Volume (Effort) + Large Progres (Result).
    -   *Bearish (Divergence):* High Volume (Effort) + Small Progress (Result). Indicates Absorption (Limit orders blocking the move).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the Spring
The "Spring" is the most powerful signal.
1.  Price breaks the bottom of a range.
2.  Volume is light (No supply).
3.  Price reclaims the range rapidly.
4.  **Trade:** Buy the close back inside. Target the Range Top.

### 4.2 Trading the LPS/LPSY
Entering on the first pullback *after* the SOS (Sign of Strength) breakout.
-   This avoids the "Fakeout."
-   The Composite Man defends his position here.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Volume Analysis):**
Price rallies to Resistance.
Volume is Massive.
spread (High-Low) is tiny.
Price closes mid-bar.
What is happening?
(The Composite Man is selling limit orders into the buying frenzy. Supply is absorbing Demand. Reversal imminent).

**Exercise 2 (Schematic Identification):**
Draw an Accumulation Range.
Identify the "Creek" (Wavy resistance line).
Where do you buy? (At the "Jump across the Creek" or the backup to the edge).

**Exercise 3 (Logic):**
Why does the "Composite Man" need to create a "Selling Climax"?
(To generate the liquidity required to purchase millions of shares/lots without slipping price up immediately).
