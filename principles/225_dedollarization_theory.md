# Dedollarization Theory: The End of Hegemony?

## I. Executive Summary

**Dedollarization** is the process of reducing reliance on the US Dollar for Global Trade (Invoicing) and Reserves (Store of Value). Driven by Geopolitical Risk (Weaponization of Dollar), BRICS nations are seeking alternatives. While the Dollar's death is frequently predicted ("The Widowmaker Trade"), network effects and deep liquid capital markets make displacing it extremely difficult.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Three Roles)
1.  **Unit of Account:** Commodities priced in USD.
2.  **Medium of Exchange:** SWIFT, Invoicing.
3.  **Store of Value:** Central Bank Reserves (Treasuries).
Dedollarization is happening in (3) and (2), but slowly in (1).

### Definition 2.2 (Triffin Dilemma)
To be the Reserve Currency, US must run Trade Deficits (to supply dollars to the world).
This creates Debt.
Eventually, Debt undermines confidence in the Dollar.
Conflict: Domestic needs vs Global Reserve needs.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Network Effect
You use Dollars because everyone else uses Dollars.
To switch to Yuan, you need:
-   Liquidity (Can I sell Yuan fast?).
-   Rule of Law (Will Xi seize my Yuan?).
-   Open Capital Account.
China lacks 2 and 3.
Euro is fragmented.
Gold is hard to transport.
Crypto is volatile.
"There is no alternative" (TINA).

### 3.2 The Petroyuan
Saudi accepting Yuan for oil.
They convert Yuan to Gold instantly on Shanghai Exchange?
If so, it's a "Barter" system masked as Yuan.
Significant symbolic shift.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Central Bank Gold
Central Banks bought record Gold in 2022/23.
Replacing Treasuries with Gold.
This *is* Dedollarization.
Long Gold is the trade of the multi-polar world.

### 4.2 Fragmented Markets
World splits into "Dollar Bloc" and "Commodity Bloc."
Trade between blocs is difficult.
Efficiency falls. Inflation rises.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Forex Reserves):**
USD share dropped from 70% (2000) to 58% (2023).
Slow erosion.
Not a collapse.
Replaced by "Non-traditional" currencies (CAD, AUD, CNY).

**Exercise 2 (Payment vs Reserve):**
CNY is < 3% of Reserves.
But in Russia-China trade, it is 80%.
Bilateral trade can dedollarize fast. Global reserves change slow.
