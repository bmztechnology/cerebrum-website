# Client Reporting and Communication

## I. Executive Summary

**Client Reporting** is the tangible product of Investment Management. It translates complex portfolio data into a narrative of **Performance**, **Risk**, and **Progress towards Goals**. Good reporting builds trust; opaque reporting creates suspicion. The trend is moving from static PDF quarterlies to **Interactive Dashboards** and **Storytelling**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (TWR vs MWR)
**Time Weighted Return (TWR):** Managers performance. Removes impact of cash flows.
**Money Weighted Return (MWR/IRR):** Client's actual experience. Includes impact of timing.
Gap between TWR and MWR is the "Behavior Gap."
Clients care about MWR (Did I make money?), Managers quote TWR (Did I beat the benchmark?).

### Definition 2.2 (Benchmarks)
Relative performance.
"Blended Benchmark": 60% S&P + 40% agg.
Risk of "Benchmark Shopping" (Changing benchmark to make performance look good).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Attribution Analysis
Where did return come from?
Asset Allocation (Beta)? Security Selection (Alpha)?
Brinson Model breakdown in the report.
Transparency $\implies$ Confidence.

### 3.2 Framing
Graphic design matters.
Green up arrows.
Comparing to Inflation? To Peers? To Goals?
"Goal Based Reporting": Funded Status of Retirement (80%) is more important than beating S&P 500 by 1%.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Mobile First
Clients check portfolio on phone.
Push notifications: "Dividend received."
Gamification risks?
Immediacy of communication during crisis (Push notification: "We are monitoring the situation").

### 4.2 Hyper-Personalization
Video statements.
AI generated narrative: "Dear John, your holding in Tesla helped you this month..."
Scalable personal touch.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Net of Fees):**
Always report Net.
Gross reporting is misleading and often illegal (GIPS).
Showing the fee explicitly on the statement? Transparency test.

**Exercise 2 (The One Page Summary):**
Clients don't read 50 pages.
Executive Summary is everything.
Visual hierarchy.
