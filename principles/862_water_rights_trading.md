# Water Rights Trading

## I. Executive Summary

**Water Markets** (Australia, California) treat water as a tradable commodity detached from land. Farmers trade **Entitlements** (Permanent Rights) and **Allocations** (Annual Volume). Microstructure is driven by **Hydrology** (Rainfall), **Storage Levels**, and **Crop Economics** (Almonds need water at any price).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cap and Trade for Water)
Catchment area (Murray-Darling Basin).
Cap on total extraction.
Rights allocated to farmers.
Trading allowed.
If Farmer A (Rice) has low margin, and Farmer B (Almonds) has high margin.
A sells to B.
Economic efficiency.

### Definition 2.2 (Spot vs Forward)
**Spot:** "I need 1 Megaliter (ML) today to finish harvest."
**Forward:** "I need 100 ML next year."
**Lease:** Renting the entitlement for a year.
NQH2O (Nasdaq Veles California Water Index). Futures contract.
Cash settled. No physical delivery. (Hedging tool).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Almond Thesis
Permanent crops (Trees) cannot fallow.
If drought hits, Almond farmer *must* buy water or trees die (Capital destruction).
Inelastic demand curve.
Rice/Cotton annual crops can choose not to plant. (Elastic).
Price is set by the marginal "Tree" buyer in a drought.

### 3.2 Convoy Losses
Moving water from Dam A to Farm B via river.
Evaporation / Seepage losses (30%).
Who pays for loss?
Exchange rate: 1 ML at source = 0.7 ML at destination.
Impacts spatial arbitrage.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Carry Trade
Buy Allocation in wet year (Price \$50/ML).
Store in Dam (Carryover capacity).
Wait for dry year.
Sell at \$1000/ML.
Risk: Dam spill. If dam overflows, your carryover is "spilled" (deleted) first.
"Spill Risk" measures probability of loss.

### 4.2 Environmental Water Holder
Government buys back rights to flush the river (for fish).
Govt is the "Whale" in the market.
Buybacks raise floor price.
Political risk: Farmers hate "Buybacks" (hollows out rural towns).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Michael Burry Trade):**
"Investing in water."
Buying almond farms with senior water rights.
Not trading water futures (too illiquid).
Trading the *shadow water* embedded in food.
Exporting water via almonds.

**Exercise 2 (Zone Restrictions):**
Barma Choke (Narrow part of river).
Trade restriction: Can't move water from Upstream to Downstream freely.
Price bifurcation.
Zone A \$100. Zone B \$150.
Physical constraint prevents arb.
