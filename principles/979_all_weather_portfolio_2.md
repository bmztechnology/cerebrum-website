# The All Weather Portfolio 2.0

## I. Executive Summary

Ray Dalio's **All-Weather Portfolio** (Risk Parity) was designed for the last 40 years of falling interest rates. **All-Weather 2.0** adapts this concept for an **Inflationary/Volatile** regime. It adds **Trend Following**, **Long Volatility**, and **Crypto** to the traditional Equity/Bond/Gold/Commodities mix.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Risk Parity)
Equalize Risk, not Capital.
Stocks are 3x more volatile than Bonds.
Standard 50/50 portfolio is 90% Risk in Stocks.
Risk Parity: Lever up Bonds to match Stock volatility.
Result: Smoother equity curve.
Weakness: Vulnerable to rising rates (both leveraged bonds and stocks fall).

### Definition 2.2 (The Four Quadrants)
1. Growth Rising, Inflation Rising (Emerging Markets, Commodities).
2. Growth Rising, Inflation Falling (Stocks - Goldilocks).
3. Growth Falling, Inflation Rising (Stagflation - Commodities, TIPS, Gold).
4. Growth Falling, Inflation Falling (Deflation - Nominal Bonds).
Portfolio must have assets in all 4 boxes.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Adding the Fifth Element: Convexity
Traditional assets are "Short Volatility" (Panic hurts them).
Need a "Long Volatility" asset.
Managed Futures (Trend Following).
Long Put Options (Tail Risk).
Bitcoin (Digital Gold / Tech Call Option hybrid).
The 2.0 Portfolio includes a 20% allocation to "Crisis Alpha."

### 3.2 Dynamic Risk Parity
Static weights fail when correlations change.
If Stock/Bond correlation goes to +1.0, reduce leverage.
"Vol Control."
Target 10% Volatility.
If realised Vol > 10%, sell everything to Cash.
Preservation of capital during "Correlated Crashes."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Implementation
30% Global Equities (Value Tilt).
20% Bonds (Short Duration / TIPS).
20% Commodities (Gold + Industrial).
20% Trend Following (CTA).
10% Crypto/VC.
Rebalance monthly.

### 4.2 The Leverage Question
Risk Parity requires leverage to get decent returns.
In High Rate environment, Cost of Leverage > Return on Bonds?
De-leveraging Risk Parity.
Shift from "Levered Bonds" to "Unlevered Cash/Alts."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Backtesting 1970s):**
Standard All-Weather did okay (Gold/Commodities carried it).
Stock/Bond only portfolio got destroyed (Real return -50%).
All-Weather 2.0 (with Trend) crushed it. (Trends were huge in 70s).

**Exercise 2 (The Crypto Allocation):**
Is 1% allocation enough?
Asymmetric upside.
If BTC goes 10x, 1% becomes 10%.
If BTC goes to 0, 1% loss is noise.
Kelly Criterion suggests 1-5% for high-payoff/high-variance bets.
