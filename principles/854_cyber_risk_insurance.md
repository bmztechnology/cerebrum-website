# Cyber Risk Insurance and Ransomware

## I. Executive Summary

**Cyber Insurance** is the fastest-growing market segment, covering **Data Breach**, **Ransomware**, and **Business Interruption**. The microstructure is chaotic due to the **Lack of Historical Data**, **Correlation Risk** (One cloud outage affects everyone), and the **adversarial nature** of the threat (Hackers target insured entities).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Silent Cyber)
Traditional Property/Liability policies didn't exclude Cyber.
"Ambiguity."
Insurers paying cyber claims on property policies (e.g., Malware causes blast furnace to overheat).
Market moves to "Affirmative Cyber" (Explicit coverage) or "Cyber Exclusion."

### Definition 2.2 (The Ransomware Spiral)
Insurer pays Ransom (\$5M).
Hackers learn: "These companies pay."
Hackers target insured companies more.
Premiums rise.
Moral Hazard?
Government considering banning ransom payments to break the cycle.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Accumulation Risk (Systemic)
Hurricane hits Florida (Local).
CrowdStrike update bricks Windows (Global).
Cyber is un-diversifiable geographically.
Aggregration modeling is difficult.
Capital constraint: Market cannot cover a "Cyber Katrina."
Need for Government backstop?

### 3.2 Attribution Difficulty
War Exclusion.
"Acts of War" are excluded.
NotPetya (Russian attack on Ukraine) spilled over to Merck/Maersk.
Insurers declared it "War." Refused to pay.
Courts ruled for Policyholders (Cyber war not defined clearly).
Contracts being rewritten to define "State-Backed Cyber Attack."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Security Posture Signaling
Insurers scan applicant's network (Port scan).
Score security (BitSight).
Good Score $\implies$ Lower Premium.
Insurance driving hygiene compliance.
"The Fire Inspector of the Internet."

### 4.2 Captive Cyber
Pricing is skyrocketing (Hard Market).
Corporations form Captives to self-insure Cyber.
Access Reinsurance market directly.
Data sharing: Captive collects detailed attack data to improve defense.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Business Interruption - BI):**
Ransomware locks systems for 3 weeks.
Revenue loss.
Forensic accounting required.
Proving "What would have happened."
High friction claims.

**Exercise 2 (Double Extortion):**
1. Encrypt Data (pay to unlock).
2. Exfiltrate Data (pay to prevent leak).
Insurance covers Ransom (1) vs Liablity for Leak (2)?
Scope of coverage matters.
