# Transmission Mechanisms: From Rates to Reality

## I. Executive Summary

The **Transmission Mechanism** describes how a change in the Central Bank's policy rate actually affects the real economy (Inflation and GDP). It acts through multiple channels: Interest Rates, Asset Prices, Exchange Rates, and Credit Availability. The "Lag" of monetary policy (12-18 months) exists because these channels take time to propagate through the plumbing of the economy.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Channels)
1.  **Interest Rate Channel:** Higher rates $\to$ Cost of Capital rises $\to$ Investment falls $\to$ Demand falls.
2.  **Wealth Channel:** Higher rates $\to$ Asset Prices (Stocks/Houses) fall $\to$ Consumers feel poor $\to$ Consumption falls.
3.  **Exchange Rate Channel:** Higher rates $\to$ Currency strengthens $\to$ Imports cheap, Exports expensive $\to$ Net Exports fall.
4.  **Credit Channel:** Higher rates $\to$ Collateral value falls $\to$ Banks tighten lending standards.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The "Long and Variable Lag"
Friedman's famous observation.
Rate hike today hits the Stock Market instantly (Wealth Channel).
Hits the Housing Market in 6 months (Mortgage Channel).
Hits Corporate Investment in 12 months (CapEx planning).
Hits Inflation in 18 months.
Policy error risk: Hiking until inflation falls means you hiked too much (Overshoot).

### 3.2 Broken Transmission
In a financial crisis, the Credit Channel breaks.
Banks refuse to lend at ANY rate (Liquidity Trap).
Fed cuts to 0%, but Mortgage rates stay at 6% (Spread widening).
Solution: QE (Bypass banks, buy assets directly).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sector Rotation
Early Cycle (Transmission starting): Short Homebuilders, Tech.
Late Cycle (Transmission realized): Long Consumer Staples (Recession hedge).
Watch "Financial Conditions Index" (FCI) - a composite of the channels.

### 4.2 Forex Impact
For small open economies (Australia, Canada), the Exchange Rate channel is dominant.
RBA hikes $\to$ AUD up $\to$ Economy slows fast.
For US, Interest Rate channel is dominant (Service economy).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Refinancing Wall):**
If Corporate Debt is fixed for 5 years.
Rate hikes today don't hurt them.
Until Year 5, when they must refinance at 5% instead of 1%.
The "Lag" is essentially the duration of fixed-rate debt in the system.

**Exercise 2 (Mortgages):**
USA: 30-Year Fixed. (Transmission is slow, people lock in low rates).
UK/Aus: Floating Rates. (Transmission is instant, payments jump next month).
Fed has to hike HIGHER than BOE to get the same slowdown effect.
