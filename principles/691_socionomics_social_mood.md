# Socionomics Social Mood

## I. Executive Summary

**Socionomics** (Robert Prechter) posits that **Social Mood** drives social events, including stock markets, politics, and fashion. Unlike the standard view (News $\implies$ Mood $\implies$ Market), Socionomics argues **Mood $\implies$ Market $\implies$ News**. The Stock Market is the most sensitive barometer of Social Mood. A Bull Market (Positive Mood) leads to peace, shorter skirts, and pop music. A Bear Market (Negative Mood) leads to war, long skirts, and punk rock.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Social Mood)
A shared mental state derived from herding bio-chemistry.
Endogenous.
Fractal (Elliot Wave Principle).
Waves of optimism and pessimism are patterned and predictable.

### Definition 2.2 (Causality Reversal)
Events do not cause bear markets.
Bear markets (Negative Mood) cause events.
Pearl Harbor happened *because* mood was already darkening globally.
2001 Terror Attacks happened *after* the market topped in 2000.
Negative mood invites conflict.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Wave Principle
5 Waves up (Optimism), 3 Waves down (Pessimism).
Fractal structure.
Market prices capture the mood instantly.
Political polls capture it with a lag.
GDP captures it with a huge lag.

### 3.2 Cultural Correlation
**Bull Market:** Hero movies (Avengers), Bright colors, Centrist politics, Globalism.
**Bear Market:** Horror movies (Zombie), Dark colors, Extremist/Populist politics, Protectionism.
Using pop culture to diagnose the wave count.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Political Forecasting
Incumbents win in Bull Markets (Positive Mood).
Incumbents lose in Bear Markets.
The economy is secondary; the *Mood* (reflected in the Dow) is primary.
Predicting Brexit / Trump based on a topping market / negative mood trend.

### 4.2 Contrarian Timing
If mood is hysterical (Manic), the top is near.
If mood is despairing (Depressive), the bottom is near.
Socionomics provides a framework for "Sentiment Analysis" beyond simple Put/Call ratios.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Skirt Length Indicator):**
Hemline Index.

1930s (Bear): Long skirts.
1960s (Bull): Miniskirts.
1970s (Bear): Maxi skirts.
2020s?

**Exercise 2 (Pandemics):**

Controversial, but consistent with the "Endogenous" view.
