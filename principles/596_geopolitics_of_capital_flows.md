# Geopolitics of Capital Flows

## I. Executive Summary

**Geopolitics** drives capital flows. From **Sanctions** (Russia) to **Trade Wars** (US-China) to **Petrodollar Recycling**, the movement of money is an instrument of statecraft. Asset Managers must now incorporate **Geopolitical Risk** as a primary factor, no longer assuming free markets or the rule of law in cross-border investing.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Weaponization of Finance)
SWIFT Ban.
Freezing Central Bank Reserves.
USD as a weapon.
Forces rivals to seek alternatives (Dedollarization).
"Friend-shoring" of supply chains and capital.

### Definition 2.2 (Capital Controls)
Restrictions on moving money out.
China: Closed capital account.
Argentina: Currency traps.
ETF risk: buying an ETF of a country with capital controls means you might not get money out.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Thucydides Trap
