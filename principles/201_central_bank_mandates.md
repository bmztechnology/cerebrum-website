# Central Bank Mandates: The Rules of the Game

## I. Executive Summary

Central Banks are algorithms enacted by legislation. Their **Mandates** define their objective function. The Federal Reserve has a "Dual Mandate" (Inflation + Employment). The ECB has a "Single Mandate" (Price Stability). The PBOC has a "Multi-Mandate" (Growth + Stability + Currency). Predicting policy requires knowing exactly what success looks like for *that specific* bank.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Federal Reserve Act)
"Maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
-   Key: Fed will tolerate higher inflation if Unemployment is high (dovish bias).

### Definition 2.2 (The ECB Maastricht Treaty)
"The primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability." (Target 2%).
-   Key: ECB is historically more hawkish. It raised rates in 2011 amidst a crisis because inflation ticked up. (Mistake).

### Definition 2.3 (Bank of Japan - Deflation Fighter)
Mandate: 2% Inflation target (from below).
Reality: Fighting 30 years of deflation.
Tool: Yield Curve Control (YCC).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Reaction Functions
The "Algo" of the governor.
Hawk: Weight on Inflation > Weight on Growth.
Dove: Weight on Growth > Weight on Inflation.
Markets price the "Reaction Function" (e.g., "The Fed Put").

### 3.2 Fiscal Dominance
When Govt Debt is so high ($120\%$ GDP) that the Central Bank *cannot* raise rates without causing sovereign default.
The Mandate effectively shifts to "Solvency of the State."
Result: Inflation is allowed to run hot to inflate away the debt.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Divergence Trades
Fed focuses on Employment (Cutting rates to save jobs).
ECB focuses on Inflation (Keeping rates high).
Result: EUR/USD Rallies.
Macro Strategy is 90% predicting Policy Divergence.

### 4.2 Political Capture
Turkey (CBRT): Mandate is whatever the President says.
Result: Cutting rates during 80% inflation.
Currency collapse (TRY).
Avoid currencies where Independence < 50%.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Flexible Average Inflation Targeting - FAIT):**
Fed's 2020 shift.
"We will allow inflation > 2% to make up for years of < 2%."
This was the signal to go Long Commodities. It explicitly authorized the inflation spike.

**Exercise 2 (ECB vs Fed):**
Germany hates inflation (Weimar trauma).
USA hates unemployment (Great Depression trauma).
Cultural DNA dictates the Mandate.
