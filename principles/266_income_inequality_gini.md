# Income Inequality Gini: The Wealth Gap

## I. Executive Summary

**Inequality** is measured by the **Gini Coefficient** (0 = Perfect Equality, 1 = One person has everything). High inequality distorts macroeconomics: The Rich have a high "Propensity to Save" (Glut of Capital, Asset Bubbles), while the Poor have a high "Propensity to Consume" (Demand Deficiency). Extreme inequality leads to Populism, Social Unrest, and eventually, Redistribution (Tax or Revolution).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Gini Calculation)
Lorenz Curve plots Cumulative Income vs Cumulative Population.
Gini = Area between 45-degree line (Equality) and Lorenz Curve.
-   Scandinavia: 0.25 (Flat).
-   USA: 0.41 (High).
-   South Africa: 0.63 (Extreme).

### Definition 2.2 (The Great Gatsby Curve)
Relationship between Inequality (x-axis) and Social Mobility (y-axis).
High Inequality $\implies$ Low Mobility.
Rich kids stay rich; Poor kids stay poor.
"Opportunity Hoarding" (Private Schools, Tutors, Network).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Piketty's $r > g$
If Return on Capital ($r$) > Economic Growth ($g$).
Wealth grows faster than Wages.
Inherited wealth becomes dominant.
"Patrimonial Capitalism."
Only War or Revolution resets this trend historically.

### 3.2 Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)
Give $1000 to Billionaire: Saves $1000. (MPC = 0).
Give $1000 to Homeless: Spends $1000. (MPC = 1).
High Inequality $\implies$ Low Velocity of Money.
Explains why QE (Asset Boost) didn't cause CPI inflation initially, but Fiscal Stimulus (Checks to poor) did.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Luxury vs Mass Market
-   **K-Shaped Recovery:**
-   Top leg (Rich): Buy LVMH, Ferrari, Hermes. (Pricing Power, resilient).
-   Bottom leg (Poor): Short Dollar General, Walmart? Or Buy Distress?
The "Middle Class" consumer brand is the death zone (Macy's).

### 4.2 Revolution Hedges
Buy Gold. Buy Bitcoin. Buy Offshore Real Estate.
Capital Flight.
When Gini > 0.5, probability of Regime Change spikes.
Latin America playbook.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (CEO Pay Ratio):**
CEO to Worker Pay.
1960: 20:1.
2023: 300:1.
Efficiency or Rent Extraction?
Shareholder Primacy theory vs Stakeholder theory.

**Exercise 2 (Tax Policy):**
Progressive Tax reduces Gini.
VAT (Sales Tax) increases Gini (Regressive).
Fiscal Policy is the knob to adjust the Gini.
