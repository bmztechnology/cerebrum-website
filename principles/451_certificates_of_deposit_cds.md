# Certificates of Deposit CDs: Bank Funding

## I. Executive Summary

**Certificates of Deposit (CDs)** are time deposits issued by banks. Unlike savings accounts, they have fixed maturity. **Negotiable CDs (NCDs)** (Jumbo CDs > \$100k) trade in secondary markets and are a key wholesale funding tool for banks. **Brokered CDs** are distributed by brokerages to retail investors, allowing banks to gather deposits nationally without branches.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Negotiable CD)
Bearer instrument (or book entry).
Can be sold before maturity.
Yield typically > Treasuries (Credit risk of Bank).
Main buyers: MMFs, Corporations.

### Definition 2.2 (Yankee CD)
CD issued in US by a branch of a foreign bank (e.g., BNP Paribas New York).
Yield > Domestic CD.
Reflects "Home Country" risk + demand to fund USD assets.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Deposit Beta
As Fed hikes rates, Saving Account rates rise slowly (Beta 0.2).
CD rates rise fast (Beta 0.8) to compete with Treasuries.
Banks shift funding from Savings to CDs to retain deposits.
NIM (Net Interest Margin) compression.

### 3.2 FDIC Insurance
Limit \$250k per depositor per bank.
**CDARS (IntraFi):** Network breaks large deposit (\$10M) into 50 chunks of \$200k placed at different banks.
Provides full FDIC insurance for massive amounts.
Regulatory arbitrage? Or efficiency?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Window Dressing
Banks issue CDs at quarter end to bolster liquidity ratios (LCR).
Rates spike temporarily.

### 4.2 Callable CDs
Bank has option to call the CD after 1 year.
Pays higher yield.
Sold to Retail.
Structure: Fixed Rate Bond - Call Option.
Retail investor is short volatility.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fixed vs Floating):**
Floating Rate CDs (SOFR linked).
Popular when rates are rising.
Bank hedges asset sensitivity.

**Exercise 2 (Run on the Bank):**
NCDs are "Hot Money."
Sophisticated investors pull funding instantly (do not roll).
Silicon Valley Bank: High reliance on uninsured deposits (similar to wholesale funding run).
