# Sovereign Debt Restructuring Paris Club

## I. Executive Summary

**Sovereign Debt** differs from Corporate Debt because you generally cannot seize the assets of a country (Sovereign Immunity). Restructuring involves a negotiation between the Sovereign and Creditors: **Private** (Eurobonds), **Bilateral** (Paris Club / China), and **Multilateral** (IMF). The game theory focuses on **Holdouts** (Vulture Funds) and **Collective Action Clauses (CACs)**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Paris Club)
Cartel of rich creditor nations (Western).
Coordinate debt relief for poor nations.
Rule: "Comparability of Treatment."
If Paris Club forgives 50%, Private Creditors must also forgive 50%.
China is *not* a Paris Club member. Creating coordination friction.

### Definition 2.2 (The Haircut)
**Principal Haircut:** Reduce face value (100 $\to$ 70).
**Coupon Haircut:** Reduce interest rate.
**Maturity Extension:** Pay later.
**NPV Reduction:** The combined economic loss.
Creditors prefer Extension (Extend and Pretend) over Principal Haircut (Realized Loss).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The IMF Conditionality
IMF lends into crisis (Lender of Last Resort).
Conditions: Austerity, Privatization, Tax Hikes.
"Structural Adjustment."
Political suicide for the debtor government.
Moral Hazard: Does IMF bailout encourage reckless lending by banks?

### 3.2 The Holdout Problem
90% of bondholders agree to swap old bonds for new (worth less).
10% refuse (Holdout).
They sue for 100% payment (Elliott Management vs Argentina).
If they win, they get paid in full.
Incentive: Be the Holdout.
Solution: CACs (Collective Action Clauses) force the 10% to accept if 75% vote yes.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Jurisdiction Arbitrage
Bonds issued under **New York Law**: Easier to sue. High creditor protection.
Bonds issued under **Local Law**: Sovereign can simply change the law to default legally.
Spread: NY Law yields < Local Law yields.

### 4.2 Debt-for-Nature Swaps
Belize 2021.
Buy back debt at discount.
Issue "Blue Bond" backed by TNC (The Nature Conservancy).
Use savings to protect coral reefs.
Restructuring with an ESG twist.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Pari Passu Saga):**
Argentina defaulted.
Paid "Exchange Bondholders" (Who accepted haircut). Refused Holdouts.
US Judge Griesa: "Pari Passu" (Equal Footing) means you can't pay Exchange without paying Holdouts.
Blocked ALL payments.
Forced Argentina to settle.
Legal tech changes sovereign risk.

**Exercise 2 (China's Hidden Debt):**
Belt and Road lending.
Often confidential. Collateralized by ports/resources.
IMF cannot restructure if they don't know the total debt stack.
Transparency crisis in Africa (Zambia).
