# Urbanization vs Deurbanization

## I. Executive Summary

Cities are engines of productivity (Agglomeration Effects). But **Remote Work** (Zoom) breaks the link between **Residence** and **Job**. This triggers **De-urbanization** (Donut Effect), emptying city centers (Commercial Real Estate Crash) and booming suburbs/rural areas. The synthesis predicts the rise of **Network States** and **Charter Cities** competing for digital nomads.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Agglomeration Economies)
Why squeeze into NYC?
Knowledge Spillover. Serendipity. Deep Labor Pool.
Scale > Sum of Parts.
West (2017): City output scales superlinearly ($N^{1.15}$).
Does Zoom replicate the spillover? Or just the meeting?

### Definition 2.2 (The Doom Loop of Cities)
Remote work $\to$ Less commuters $\to$ Transit revenue falls / Tax base falls $\to$ Services cut / Crime rises $\to$ More people leave.
Detroit model applied to San Francisco?
Commercial Real Estate (Office) value $\to$ 0.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Digital Nomadism
Arbitrage: Earn San Francisco Salary, Spend Bali Cost of Living.
Massive surplus.
Wealth transfer from Hubs to Spokes.
Gentrification of the world.
Visa competition (Golden Visas).

### 3.2 The 15-Minute City
Urban design philosophy.
Everything within 15 min walk.
Human-scale.
Reaction against car-centric sprawl.
Walkability premium in real estate.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Office-to-Resi Conversion
Convert empty towers to apartments.
Hard (Plumbing/Windows).
Regulatory easing required.
The biggest construction trend of the decade?

### 4.2 Investing in "Zoom Towns"
Boise, Austin, Nashville.
Secondary cities with good lifestyle/taxes.
Short NY/SF/Chicago?
Or are Mega-Cities resilient (Culture/Nightlife)?
Winner-Take-All Cities vs The Rest.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Starlink and Rural Land):**
If internet is everywhere, you can live anywhere.
Rural land value increases.
Spread between Urban and Rural land compresses.

**Exercise 2 (Charter Cities):**
Prospera (Honduras).
Private laws. Crypto friendly.
Start-up Cities.
Balaji Srinivasan's "The Network State."
Buying land to form a new jurisdiction.
