# Gann Theory: Time/Price Squaring

## I. Executive Summary

W.D. Gann (early-20th century) was a legendary trader who used Geometry, Astrology, and Ancient Mathematics to forecast markets. His central thesis was the **Unity of Time and Price**. He believed that when Time and Price are "Squared" (Balanced), a change in trend is inevitable. While distinct from modern quantitative finance, Gann Theory provides a rigorous geometric framework for support and resistance through angles and cycles.

## II. Formal Definitions

### 2.1 The Geometric Angles (Gann Fans)
Lines drawn from significant pivots at specific slopes.
-   **1x1 (45 degrees):** The Balance Line. 1 Unit of Price per 1 Unit of Time.
    -   *Rule:* If Price > 1x1, Trend is Strong Bull.
    -   *Rule:* If Price breaks 1x1, Trend is weakening.
-   **2x1:** 2 Units Price / 1 Unit Time (Steep Bull).
-   **1x2:** 1 Price / 2 Time (Slow Bull).

### 2.2 The Square of Nine
A spiral number chart starting at 1 in the center. Used to find Time/Price resistance.
-   Traders look for Cardinal Cross and Ordinal Cross numbers as turning points.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Cycle Theory
Gann placed heavy emphasis on Time Cycles.
-   **Anniversary Dates:** Markets often reverse on the 1-year, 2-year, or 10-year anniversary of a major Top/Bottom.
-   **Static Cycles:** 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 144 days.

### 3.2 Squaring Price and Time
When Price (e.g., \$100) equals Time (e.g., 100 days from low), the market is "Squared."
Expect a reversal.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The 50% Retracement
Gann was the first to popularize the 50% level.
"Price will always return to the 50% mark of the previous range."
*Strategy:* Measure the Range. Place Limit at 50%.

### 4.2 Fan Line Support
1.  Draw 1x1 from the Major Low.
2.  If price crashes, watch the 1x2 angle.
3.  If price bounces off 1x2, the trend remains structurally intact, just slower.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Drawing):**
Scale is critical.
If 1 Day = 10 Pips.
Then the 1x1 line rises 10 pips every bar.
If you zoom in/out, the visual angle changes, but the mathematical value must remain fixed. Why is "Fixed Scale" charting necessary for Gann?

**Exercise 2 (Cycles):**
Major Top was September 1st.
Count 90 days (Quarterly cycle).
December 1st.
Watch for a reversal.

**Exercise 3 (Critique):**
Gann died with \$50M (inflation adjusted).
Skeptics say he made it selling courses, not trading.
Does the validity of the geometry depend on the author's PnL? (No, geometry is objective; application is subjective).
