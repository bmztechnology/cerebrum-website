# Availability Heuristic Salience

## I. Executive Summary

The **Availability Heuristic** is the tendency to judge the probability of an event by the ease with which examples come to mind. Events that are **Recenct**, **Emotional**, or **Vivid** (Salient) are judged as more likely than they statistically are. In finance, this causes investors to overreact to recent news (Crash of 2008, Pandemic 2020) while ignoring base rates of dull, slow-moving risks (Inflation, Demographic decline).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Ease of Retrieval)
$P(Event) \propto Ease(Memory)$.
Shark attacks vs Falling airplane parts.
Sharks are vivid (Jaws). Falling parts are boring.
Parts kill more people.
Investors fear "The Next Lehman" (Vivid) more than "Gradual margin compression."

### Definition 2.2 (Salience Theory)
Bordalo, Gennaioli, Shleifer.
Assets with "Salient" payoffs (Lottery stocks with 1000% upside) are overweighted.
Investors pay a premium for skewness.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Recency Bias
A subset of Availability.
Weighting $t_{-1}$ heavily, $t_{-10}$ zero.
If market was up last month, "Stocks are safe."
If market crashed last month, "Stocks are risky."
Buy High, Sell Low behavior.

### 3.2 Media Amplification
"If it bleeds, it leads."
News focuses on outliers (3-sigma events).
Consumer absorbs a distorted view of reality (The "Mean World Syndrome").
Market sentiment is driven by headlines, not fundamentals.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Contrarian Investing
Exploiting Availability.
When news is terrible and everyone remembers the crash $\implies$ Buy.
When news is euphoric and everyone remembers the crypto millionaire $\implies$ Sell.
"Be fearful when others are greedy."

### 4.2 Disaster Insurance
Selling OTM Puts on the Index.
After a crash, Implied Volatility (Fear) creates expensive premiums.
Availability of the crash makes protection expensive.
Systematic vol selling harvests this premium.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Base Rate Neglect):**
"This startup is the next Google."
Availability: You remember Google.
Base Rate: 99% of startups fail.
Rational pricing should be closer to failure, not Google.

**Exercise 2 (The Earthquake Insurance Puzzle):**
Purchase of earthquake insurance spikes *after* the quake.
Risk is arguably lower (pressure released)?
But Availability is highest.
