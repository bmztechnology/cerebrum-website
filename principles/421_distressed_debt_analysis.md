# Distressed Debt Analysis: The Fulcrum

## I. Executive Summary

**Distressed Debt** invests in the bonds of companies near or in bankruptcy (Chapter 11). The strategy is less about yield and more about **Asset Valuation** and **Legal Process**. The goal is to buy debt at a deep discount (e.g., 30 cents) and either receive Par upon recovery or convert the debt into **Controlling Equity** in the reorganized company.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Fulcrum Security)
The layer of the capital structure where the value of the enterprise "runs out."
-   Enterprise Value (EV) = \$500M.
-   Senior Debt = \$300M (Covered).
-   Junior Bond = \$400M (Only \$200M covered).
-   Equity = \$0.
Junior Bond is the **Fulcrum**. They get the equity of the NewCo.
Senior Debt gets reinstated or paid cash. Old Equity gets wiped out.

### Definition 2.2 (Recovery Rate)
Expected payout in default.
Price $\approx PD \times Recovery$.
Distressed trading is betting that *Market Implied Recovery < Actual Recovery*.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Chapter 11 Dynamics
-   **Pre-Pack:** Deal agreed before filing. Fast (3 months).
-   **Free Fall:** No deal. Litigation war (1-2 years). "Cash Burn" destroys value.
-   **DIP Financing:** Debtor-in-Possession loan. Super-priority. Funds the bankruptcy process.

### 3.2 Blocking Position
2/3 of dollar amount needed to approve Plan of Reorganization.
Hedge fund buys 34% of a bond class ("Blocking Stake").
Can hold the process hostage to demand better terms.
"Holdout Value."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Loan-to-Own
