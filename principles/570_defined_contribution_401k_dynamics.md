# Defined Contribution 401k Dynamics

## I. Executive Summary

**Defined Contribution (DC)** plans (401k) shift investment risk from employer to employee. The employer contributes a matched amount, but the final payout depends on market performance. The ecosystem is dominated by **Target Date Funds (TDFs)**, dealing with **Behavioral Inertia** (employees don't trade). The goal is "Accumulation" followed by "Decumulation," with a focus on fees and tax efficiency.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Glidepath)
Asset Allocation changes with age.
Age 25: 90% Equity / 10% Bond.
Age 65: 40% Equity / 60% Bond.
"To" vs "Through" glidepaths.
"To": Conservative at retirement date.
"Through": Remains aggressive past retirement (longevity risk).

### Definition 2.2 (Auto-Enrollment)
Nudge Theory (Thaler).
Defaults matter.
Participation jumps from 40% to 90% with Auto-Enrollment.
Default investment: TDF.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Sequence of Returns Risk
Market crash at age 25: Irrelevant (Time to recover, buying low).
Market crash at age 64: Catastrophic.
"The Red Zone" (5 years before retirement).
TDFs try to mitigate this, but 2008 showed many 2010 TDFs still lost 25%.

### 3.2 Fee Sensitivity
Compounding costs.
1% fee over 40 years consumes 30% of final wealth.
Regulatory push (DOL Fiduciary Rule) for low-cost Index Funds in DC plans.
The death of active management in 401ks?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Stable Value Funds
Unique to DC plans.
Insurance-wrapped bond portfolio.
Guarantees principal + steady yield (beating Money Market).
Capacity constraints.

### 4.2 The Annuity Puzzle
Why don't retirees buy annuities?
(Protection against living too long).
Behavioral preference for "Control" and "Bequest" (leaving money to kids).
New regulations (SECURE Act) trying to embed annuities in 401ks.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Leakage):**
Cashing out 401k when changing jobs.
Tax penalty + Loss of compounding.
Massive destroyer of wealth for lower income workers.

**Exercise 2 (Self-Directed Brokerage):**
Allows buying individual stocks/crypto in 401k.
Utilization is low, but risk is high.
Fiduciary liability for the employer?
