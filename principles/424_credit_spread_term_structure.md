# Credit Spread Term Structure: Jumping to Default

## I. Executive Summary

The **Term Structure of Credit Spreads** (Credit Curve) plots spread against maturity. For **Investment Grade** firms, the curve is upward sloping (Time = Uncertainty). For **Distressed** firms, the curve is **Inverted** (Short term spread > Long term spread). This inversion implies a high probability of immediate default; if the firm survives the short term, its credit quality must have improved (Conditional Survival).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Hazard Rate $\lambda$)
Intensity of default arrival.
$PD(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$.
If $\lambda$ is constant, Survival Probability decays exponentially.
Credit Spread $S \approx \lambda(1 - R)$.

### Definition 2.2 (Inverted Curve Math)
Spot PD 1Y = 20%.
Spot PD 5Y (Conditional) = 5%.
Market thinks: "They either die in 12 months or they fix the problem."
Short term bonds trade at huge yields. Long term bonds trade at lower yields (priced on the success scenario).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Liquidity Theory
Long dated corporate bonds are illiquid.
Liquidity premium increases with maturity.
Steepens the credit curve for IG.

### 3.2 LBO Risk
IG Curve 30Y is steep because of LBO risk.
"Event Risk."
Today AAA. In 10 years, maybe Private Equity buys it and loads 5x leverage.
Long bonds price this option.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Flattener Trade (Credit)
Bull market.
Buy Long Term Credit.
Curve flattens as "Event Risk" decreases?
Actually, in Bull market, junk rally causes Inverted curves to normalize (Steepen).
Distress $\to$ Normal. Front end rally is massive.

### 4.2 Curve Roll Down
Steep Credit curve.
Buy 5Y. Roll to 4Y.
Spread tightens.
Price rises.
Double Roll Down: Rate Roll + Spread Roll.
Powerful alpha engine in IG portfolios.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (CDS Curve):**
5Y CDS is liquid point.
1Y CDS is illiquid.
Trading the 1Y-5Y curve in CDS is pure "Jump to Default" betting.

**Exercise 2 (Z-Score Impact):**
As Z-Score drops into distress, Curve Inverts.
Visual signal of market panic.
