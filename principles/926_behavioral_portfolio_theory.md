# Behavioral Portfolio Theory

## I. Executive Summary

**Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** assumes investors optimize Mean-Variance for the *whole* portfolio. **Behavioral Portfolio Theory (BPT)** (Statman/Shefrin) argues investors build portfolios in **Layers** (Mental Accounting). A "Safety Layer" (Cash/Bonds) for survival, and a "Get Rich Layer" (Options/Crypto) for aspiration. This explains why people hold Insurance *and* Lottery Tickets simultaneously.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Mental Accounting)
Bucketing money.
"This is for retirement" (Risk Averse).
"This is for Vegas/Crypto" (Risk Seeking).
Fungibility is violated. \$1 in Vegas bucket $\neq$ \$1 in Retirement bucket.
Portfolios are pyramids of buckets.

### Definition 2.2 (SP/A Theory)
Security, Potential, Aspiration.
Investors maximize Potential for a given level of Security.
They focus on **Downside Protection** (Safety First) and **Upside Potential** (Skewness).
They ignore Correlation/Covariance (the middle).
Result: The "Barbell" portfolio naturally emerges from psychology.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Disposition Effect in Portfolios
Investors sell winners to "feed" the losers.
Rebalancing? Or Doubling Down?
Rational Rebalancing: Sell Overweight, Buy Underweight to restore targets.
Behavioral: Sell Winners to feel good, Buy Losers to prove you were right.

### 3.2 Dividends vs Capital Gains
Miller-Modigliani: Dividends don't matter (can create homemade dividends by selling stock).
BPT: Investors love Dividends.
"Don't dip into principal."
Dividends = "Free spending money."
Principal = "Sacred capital."
Self-control mechanism to prevent overconsumption.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Goal-Based Investing
Wealth Management industry shifting from MPT (Sharpe Ratio) to Goals.
"Bucket 1: House (T-Bills)."
"Bucket 2: College (50/50)."
"Bucket 3: Legacy (100% Equity)."
Optimizing each bucket separately.
Mathematically suboptimal? Yes.
Psychologically optimal? Yes (Client sticks to the plan).

### 4.2 Structured Products Design
Designing a note: "100% Principal Protection + 50% of S&P Upside."
Matches the BPT pyramid.
Layer 1 (Safety) is satisfied.
Layer 2 (Upside) is satisfied.
Exploits the demand for skewer distributions.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Home Bias):**
Investors hold 80% domestic stocks.
MPT says: Diversify globally.
BPT says: Familiarity breeds comfort. "I know Apple."
Regret minimization (Fear of missing out on neighbor's gains).

**Exercise 2 (Robo-Advisors):**
Automated Goal-Based Investing.
"What is this money for?"
Visualizing the buckets helps users tolerate volatility.
"The trip to Hawaii is down 10%" feels better than "My portfolio is down 10%."
