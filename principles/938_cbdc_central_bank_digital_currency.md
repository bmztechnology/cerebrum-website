# CBDC Central Bank Digital Currency

## I. Executive Summary

**Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** represent the third form of Central Bank Money (after Cash and Reserves). Unlike Reserves (only for banks) and Cash (physical), CBDCs are **Digital Liabilities of the State available to the Public**. This shift threatens to **Disintermediate Commercial Banks** and allows for **Programmable Money** (Stimulus that expires).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Two-Tier Model)
1.  **Central Bank:** Issues the Token (ledger entry). Guarantees the value.
2.  **Commercial Bank:** Handles KYC, Customer Service, and Wallet interface.
Prevents the "Run to the Fed" scenario where everyone moves deposits from risky banks to the risk-free Central Bank.
The Commercial Bank becomes an API layer, not a balance sheet?

### Definition 2.2 (Wholesale vs Retail)
**Wholesale CBDC:** Tokenized Reserves for Interbank Settlement. Boring but efficient (Atomic swaps).
**Retail CBDC:** "FedAccounts" for individuals. Radical.
Allows "Direct Monetary Financing" (Helicopter drops directly to wallets).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)
Physical Cash limits monetary policy.
If Rates = -5%, people hoard Cash (0% yield).
CBDC allows strictly Negative Rates.
"Your digital dollar depreciates by 5% per year to force spending."
Total control over the Velocity of Money.

### 3.2 The Privacy Dilemma
Cash is anonymous.
CBDC is the Panopticon.
State sees every transaction.
China's e-CNY: "Controllable Anonymity."
Western backlash: "Freedom Money" (Cash/Crypto) vs "Control Money" (CBDC).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Cross-Border Payments (mBridge)
Project mBridge (BIS + China + UAE).
Using CBDCs to settle trade *without* Correspondent Banks.
Bypassing SWIFT.
Geopolitical weapon against Sanctions.
"Atomic Cross-Border PvP."

### 4.2 Programmability
"Smart Money."
Food Stamp tokens that cannot buy Alcohol.
Stimulus checks that must be spent within 5 miles of home.
Fiscal Policy becomes granular code.
Regulatory enforcement (Tax collection) becomes automatic.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Bank Run of 2030):**
Silicon Valley Bank scenario.
Instead of fleeing to JP Morgan, depositors flee to CBDC.
Instant, frictional-less run.
Central Bank becomes the only bank?
"Narrow Banking" outcome.

**Exercise 2 (Nigeria eNaira):**
Adoption failed.
Why?
People prefer Cash (Privacy) or Crypto (Inflation hedge).
Trust in the Central Bank is the limiting factor for CBDC adoption.
