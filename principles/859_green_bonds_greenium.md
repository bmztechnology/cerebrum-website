# Green Bonds and The Greenium

## I. Executive Summary

**Green Bonds** are fixed income instruments where proceeds are earmarked for green projects (Solar, Wind). The **Greenium** (Green Premium) is the theoretical yield discount that issuers pay (e.g., 2bps lower yield). Microstructure involves **Use of Proceeds** certification and the risk of **Greenwashing** (using green money for brown projects).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Greenium $g$)
$$ Yield_{Green} = Yield_{Brown} - g $$
Does $g$ exist?
Empirical studies: $g \approx 1-5$ bps.
Why would investors accept lower yield?
1. Non-pecuniary utility (Warm glow).
2. Mandate constrains (Must hold 20% Green).
3. Lower risk? (Solar farm has predictable cash flow).

### Definition 2.2 (Sustainability Linked Bonds - SLBs)
Unlike Green Bonds (Use of Proceeds), SLBs are general purpose debt.
**Coupon Step-up:** If issuer misses KPI (e.g. reduce CO2 by 20%), Coupon increases by 25bps.
Perverse incentive: Investors *want* the company to fail the KPI to get higher yield?
"The Hedge Fund that cheers for pollution."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Fungibility of Money
Money is fungible.
Issuer borrows \$100M Green Bond for Solar Farm.
Frees up \$100M internal cash to drill oil.
Net result: Oil drilling happens anyway.
"Additionality" is the hard criteria to prove.

### 3.2 Regulatory Taxonomy
EU Taxonomy.
Defines what is "Green."
Gas? Nuclear? (Political fight).
If a bond is "Taxonomy Aligned," it trades at a premium.
If "Light Green," it trades flat.
Fragmentation of liquidity.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Step-Up Arb
Buy SLBs of companies likely to miss targets.
Probability of Step-up priced at 50%.
Your model says 90%.
Buy the bond.
Betting on failure.

### 4.2 Issuance Arbitrage
Issuer cost: Certification fees (\$50k).
Issuer benefit: Greenium (2bps on \$1B = \$200k/year).
NPV positive to issue Green Bond.
CFO incentive to label everything Green.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Reputational Default):**
 issuer uses Green Bond money for coal.
Bond does not legally default.
But market shuns issuer.
"Soft Default."
Yield spreads blow out on future issuance.

**Exercise 2 (Sovereign Green Bonds):**
Germany issues "Green Bund."
Issues "Twin Bond" (Identical Brown Bund).
Perfect experiment to measure Greenium.
Spread is visible (usually 1-2bps).
