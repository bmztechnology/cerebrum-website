# Baltic Dry Index: Shipping Economics

## I. Executive Summary

The **Baltic Dry Index (BDI)** measures the cost of shipping dry bulk commodities (Iron Ore, Coal, Grain) on various vessel classes (Capesize, Panamax, Supramax). It is considered a pure play on **Global Demand** because the supply of ships is inelastic in the short run (takes 2 years to build a ship). A spike in BDI signals raw material restocking; a crash signals manufacturing slowdown.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Vessel Classes)
-   **Capesize:** >150k DWT. Too big for Panama Canal (must go round Cape Horn/Good Hope). Carries Iron Ore/Coal. Volatile.
-   **Panamax:** 60-80k DWT. Fits Canal. Carries Grains.
-   **Supramax/Handysize:** Smaller. Carries Steel, Cement, Fertilizer.

### Definition 2.2 (Demurrage)
Fees paid for delays in port.
If China Port Congestion rises (due to COVID/Typhoon) $\to$ Ships waiting $\to$ Effective Supply of ships drops $\to$ Rates Spike.
Supply Chain inefficiency is bullish for Shipping Rates.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Hog Cycle
Shipping is highly cyclical.
Boom $\to$ High Rates $\to$ Owners order new ships $\to$ 2 year lag $\to$ Ships delivered $\to$ Overcapacity $\to$ Rates Crash.
Bust $\to$ Scrapping ships $\to$ Shortage $\to$ Rates Rise.
"Buy shipping stocks when they are bankrupt, sell when they pay dividends."

### 3.2 Leading Indicator?
BDI moves *before* the CPI/PPI.
It tracks the *start* of the supply chain.
Correlation with Chinese Credit Impulse is high.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 IMO Environmental Rules
Slow Steaming.
To meet emission targets, ships slow down (12 knots vs 14 knots).
Reduces effective fleet capacity by 15%.
Structural Bull Case for rates.
Order book is low because owners don't know which fuel (Methanol/Ammonia/Hydrogen) will win.

### 4.2 Iron Ore Route (C3)
Tubarao (Brazil) to Qingdao (China).
The most important active route.
If Vale (Brazil) increases output, Capesize rates fly.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (2008 Bubble):**
BDI hit 11,000.
Everyone ordered ships.
2016: BDI hit 290.
Bankruptcy wave (Hanjin).
Asset Asset prices (Ships) fell 80%.

**Exercise 2 (Dry vs Wet):**
Dry Bulk (BDI) vs Tankers (BDTI - Dirty Tanker Index).
Uncorrelated.
Unrelated supply/demand divers.
Oil Tankers boom when oil curve is in Contango (Floating Storage). Dry Bulk booms when Economy grows.
