# The Make Whole Provision

## I. Executive Summary

**Make-Whole Calls** allow an issuer to call a bond early but require paying the NPV of all future coupons (discounted at T+50bps). In Bankruptcy, the debate is: Does the **Automatic Stay** (acceleration of debt) trigger the Make-Whole premium? This amounts to hundreds of millions in value. Microstructure turns on **Solvency** and specific **Indenture Language**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Yield Maintenance)
Bond pays 10%. Market rates 5%.
Bond trades at 120 (Premium).
If Company defaults, Principal accelerates to 100 (Par).
Bondholders lose the 20 points of premium.
Make-Whole Clause: "If default accelerates debt, you must pay the Premium."
Huge fight: Energy Future Holdings (EFH) case.

### Definition 2.2 (Solvent Debtor Exception)
If Company is *Solvent* (Assets > Liabilities) but in Chapter 11 (Liquidity crisis).
Courts (Ultra Petroleum) say: You must pay the Make-Whole (contractual interest rate).
"Unimpaired" reasoning.
If Insolvent, rules are stricter.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The "Moment in Time"
Make-Whole is calculated using Treasury Yields.
If Rates are Low $\implies$ Make-Whole is High.
If Rates are High $\implies$ Make-Whole is Low.
In ZIRP era (2010-2021), Make-Wholes were massive.
Lenders fought hard.

### 3.2 Intentional Default
Company wants to refinance 10% debt.
Make-Whole cost is \$100M.
Company defaults on purpose (files Ch 11).
Debt accelerates to Par (Avoiding Make-Whole).
Refinances at 5%.
Creditors sue: "Perfect Tender" argument.
Result: Indentures now written to explicitly state "Make-Whole payable upon Bankruptcy."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Settlement Wedge
Claim: \$1B Principal + \$200M Make-Whole.
Litigation risk: 50/50.
Settlement: \$1.1B.
Debtor saves \$100M. Bondholders get \$100M premium.
Used as currency in RSA negotiations.

### 4.2 Crossover Investors
Distressed Fund buys bond at 110?
Yes, if they believe the Make-Whole (worth 130) will be upheld.
Litigation Alpha.
Reading the Judge + Reading the Indenture.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Hertz Make-Whole):**
Hertz Solvency.
Bondholders demanded post-petition interest at Contract Rate + Make-Whole.
Stockholders wanted to pay Federal Judgment Rate (Low).
Court ruled for Bondholders (mostly).
Solvency changes the rules.

**Exercise 2 (T+50 Discount):**
Discount rate = Treasury + 50bps.
If market spread is 500bps.
The Make-Whole overcompensates the lender.
"Punitive" nature?
Courts dislike penalties.
