# Private Credit and Direct Lending

## I. Executive Summary

**Private Credit** (Direct Lending) has replaced Banks as the primary lender to middle-market companies (and LBOs). Driven by **Basel III** capital constraints on banks, Private Credit funds (Ares, Apollo) raise capital from LPs to lend directly. The microstructure is **Illiquid**, **Floating Rate**, and **Covenant-Heavy** (historically), offering higher yields (Illiquidity Premium) than Public High Yield Bonds.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Unitranche Debt)
Combines Senior and Junior debt into one instrument.
One Lender (The Fund). One Interest Rate (Blended).
Speed: No inter-creditor agreement negotiation between Senior and Junior bankers.
Certainty of Execution: Crucial for LBO sponsors in competitive auctions.

### Definition 2.2 (BDCs - Business Development Companies)
Publicly traded Private Credit funds.
Retail access to the asset class.
Pass-through structure (like REITs).
Yields 8-10%.
Risks: Credit quality transparency, Fees.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Bank Disintermediation
Banks hold deposits (Flighty). Cannot hold illiquid loans.
Private Credit holds Locked LP Capital (10 years). Can hold illiquid loans.
Asset-Liability Matching.
Systemic Risk: Moving risk from Regulated Banks to Shadow Banks (Funds).
"We don't have runs on the bank because our capital is locked."

### 3.2 Floating Rate Protection
Loans are SOFR + Spread.
Inflation Hedge?
If Rates rise $\implies$ Yield rises.
Bond prices fall (Duration risk). Loans stay at Par.
Private Credit outperformed Fixed Income in 2022.
Risk: Borrower's ability to pay (Interest Coverage Ratio).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Toggles
Borrower acts stressed.
Lender allows switching cash interest to PIK interest.
Principal balance grows.
"Extend and Pretend."
Avoids realizing the default.
Accounting trick?

### 4.2 The Golden Age of Private Credit
2023. Banks retreated (Regional Bank Crisis).
Private Credit stepped in.
Charging SOFR (5%) + Spread (6%) = 11% Yield.
Equity-like returns for senior debt risk?
Or are defaults looming?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Recovery Rates):**
Public Bonds: Traded. Restructuring is messy.
Private Credit: One lender. "Key to the keys."
Control is faster in bankruptcy.
Historically higher recovery rates.

**Exercise 2 (The Origination Fee):**
Upfront fee (2-3%).
Boosts initial IRR.
Incentive to churn the portfolio/refinance frequently?
EBITDA add-backs quality check.
