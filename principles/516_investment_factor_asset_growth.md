# Investment Factor Asset Growth: Empire Building

## I. Executive Summary

The **Investment Factor (CMA: Conservative Minus Aggressive)** captures the negative relationship between **Asset Growth** and future Stock Returns. Companies that aggressively expand their balance sheets (High Capex, Acquisitions, Share Issuance) tend to underperform. Companies that "Conserve" assets (Low growth, Buybacks, Dividends) outperform. It reflects the "Empire Building" agency problem and the diminishing marginal returns on capital.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Asset Growth Anomaly)
Rank by % Change in Total Assets (YoY).
Long Bottom Decile (Conservatives).
Short Top Decile (Aggressives).
Strong alpha, independent of Value/Momentum.

### Definition 2.2 (q-Theory of Investment)
Tobin's q.
Firms should invest until Cost of Capital = Marginal Return on Investment.
Aggressive firms invest *beyond* this point (Negative NPV projects).
Why? CEO ego, overconfidence, warped incentives (EPS growth vs ROIC).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Financing Hierarchy
Pecking Order Theory.
1. Internal Cash (Cheap).
2. Debt (Medium).
3. Equity Issuance (Expensive - Signal of overvaluation).
High Asset Growth often requires External Financing (Issuance).
Issuance is a bearish signal.

### 3.2 Interaction with Value
High Growth firms usually High P/B.
CMA correlates with HML (Value).
But CMA explains returns *better* than HML in modern data.
Value is really "Low Investment + High Profitability"?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shorting M&A
Acquirers usually underperform (Winner's Curse).
Acquisition = Explosive Asset Growth.
Short the Acquirer, Long the Target? (Merger Arb).
Or just avoid serial acquirers (Roll-ups).

### 4.2 Capital Allocation Analysis
The "Outsiders" (Thorndike).
CEOs who excelled at capital allocation (Buybacks when cheap, Dividends).
Avoided dumb growth.
This is the essence of the Investment Factor.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Mining Capex Cycle):**
Miners over-invest at top of cycle (High Capex $\implies$ Low future returns).
Cut Capex at bottom (Low Asset Growth $\implies$ High future returns).
Counter-cyclical signal.

**Exercise 2 (Tech Capex):**
Amazon/Google High Capex (Cloud/AI).
Underperformed?
Exception? Or is "R&D" different from "Hard Asset" growth?
Usually literature counts Total Asset growth.
Big Tech requires massive scale.
