# Emerging Manager Programs

## I. Executive Summary

**Emerging Manager** programs are institutional mandates dedicated to smaller, newer, or minority-owned investment firms (AUM < \$500M). The thesis is that **Small Funds Outperform** due to agility (ability to trade small caps), hunger (incentive to prove themselves), and lack of "Asset Bloat." For allocators, it solves the **Capacity Constraint** issues of big funds and provides diversity targets.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Anchor Investor)
First institutional check (\$50M).
Gives credibility.
Demands "Founders Class" Economics (1 and 10, or Revenue Share).
Seeding business.

### Definition 2.2 (Graduation)
Allocators track Emerging Managers.
When they hit \$2B AUM, they "Graduate" to the core portfolio.
Risk of "Style Drift" as they get big.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Size vs Performance
Inverse relationship.
Small funds have larger opportunity sets.
Large funds become "Closet Indexers" or move to efficient Large Cap markets.
"Capacity" is the enemy of Alpha.

### 3.2 Barrier to Entry
Regulatory costs (Compliance) are fixed.
High break-even point for new funds (\$100M AUM required to keep lights on).
Emerging Manager programs provide the scale to survive the "Valley of death."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Seeding Platforms
Blackstone / Goldman Sachs Strategic Partners.
Provide capital + Back office + Marketing.
Take % of the GP (General Partner) revenue.
"Incubator" model.

### 4.2 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
Specific mandates for women-owned or minority-owned firms.
Accessing cognitive diversity.
Widening the funnel.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Operational Risk):**
Emerging managers have thin teams.
"Key Man Risk."
If the CIO gets sick, the fund closes.
ODD (Operational Due Diligence) is stricter than for big firms.

**Exercise 2 (The J-Curve of Business):**
First 2 years: Survival.
Years 3-5: Performance track record established.
Years 6+: Asset gathering.
Allocators try to enter at Year 3.
