# Rolling Down the Yield Curve: Passive Alpha

## I. Executive Summary

**Rolling Down** (or Riding) the Yield Curve is a strategy that generates excess return by holding a bond as it ages and moves to a lower-yielding point on an upward-sloping yield curve. Even if the market yield curve remains static, the specific bond's yield falls (price rises) as its maturity shortens. It is the primary source of "Structural Alpha" in Fixed Income.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Roll Down Return)
$$ Return = Coupon + PriceChange $$
If Curve is upward sloping (Spot 5Y = 3%, Spot 4Y = 2.5%).
Buy 5Y at 3%.
Hold for 1 year.
Bond becomes a 4Y bond.
If curve static, market values 4Y bond at 2.5%.
Yield fell 0.5%.
Price Rose $\approx Duration \times 0.5\%$.
Capital Gain generated by passage of time.

### Definition 2.2 (Steepness)
Strategy works best when curve is **Steep**.
Steepness at the front end (2Y-5Y) is usually highest.
"Shoulder of the Curve."
Best place to roll.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Forward Rates interpretation
If you believe Repurchase/Forward rates are predictive:
The 5Y yield is just the average of expected future short rates.
If Forward Rate holds, the Price Change from rolling down is exactly offset by the higher expected short rate?
No.
Term Premium exists.
Rolling down captures the Term Premium.
It assumes the *Forward Rate* overestimates future rate hikes.

### 3.2 Inverted Curve
Curve Inversion (Short rates > Long rates).
Roll Down is NEGATIVE.
Bond ages $\implies$ Yield Rises $\implies$ Price Falls.
Holding bonds in inverted curve is painful (Negative Carry).
Must shorter duration to T-Bills.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Ladder Maintenance
Buying 10Y, holding to 7Y. Selling. Buying new 10Y.
Constant maturity ladder.
Systematically captures roll down.

### 4.2 The 2010-2015 Trade
Fed held rates at 0%. Curve was huge steep (0% to 3%).
Buying 5Y notes was a money printing machine.
Realized Yield = Coupon + Roll Down $\approx$ 5-6%.
Risk Free.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Z-Score of Slope):**
Quant traders measure 2s10s slope vs history.
If Z-Score > 2 (Very Steep), maximize Roll Down exposure.

**Exercise 2 (Total Return Decomposition):**
Performance attribution.
How much came from "Yield"? structure.
How much from "Roll"?
How much from "Shift"?
Good managers maximize Roll.
