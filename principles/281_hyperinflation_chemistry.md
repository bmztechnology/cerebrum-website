# Hyperinflation Chemistry: The Death of Money

## I. Executive Summary

**Hyperinflation** ($>50\%$ inflation per month) is strictly a political event, not just monetary. It occurs when a government loses the fiscal trust of the populace and creates money to fund deficits directly (Fiscal Dominance). The mechanism is the collapse of **Money Demand**. People treat currency like a hot potato, leading to an infinite explosion in Velocity.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cagan Model)
Money Demand depends on Expected Inflation ($\pi^e$).
As $\pi^e \to \infty$, Money Demand $\to 0$.
Prices rise *faster* than Money Supply.
Real Money Balance ($M/P$) shrinks.
You need a wheelbarrow of cash implies there is "not enough" real money (Paradox).

### Definition 2.2 (Tax Revenue Collapse)
Tanzi Effect.
Time lag between Tax Assessment and Tax Collection.
If inflation is 50%/month, and you pay taxes 1 month late.
Real Tax Revenue falls 33%.
Deficit widens $\to$ Gov prints MORE $\to$ Inflation rises $\to$ Revenue falls more.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Supply Constraint
Hyperinflation always involves a supply shock.
Weimar (Ruhr occupation). Zimbabwe (Farm seizures). Venezuela (Oil price crash).
Money printing *responds* to the shock to keep paying soldiers/civil servants.

### 3.2 Currency Substitution
"Dollarization."
Locals stop using Local Currency. Use USD/EUR/Gold.
The "Effective" money supply of the local currency becomes tiny.
So any new printing hits a tiny base $\to$ Massive price impact.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shorting the Currency?
Cost of Carry is -100%/month.
You cannot short it (No borrow, Interest rate 1000%).
You must buy Hard Assets (Stocks, Real Estate) *in local currency terms*.
Zimbabwe Stock Market was the best performer in the world in nominal terms (+10,000%).
In Real terms (-90%).

### 4.2 Capital Controls
Govt will ban FX exit.
Checkpoints at airports.
Crypto is the modern lifeboat.
Venezuela / Turkey / Argentina $\to$ Highest Crypto adoption.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Weimar 1923):**
Price of bread: 1 Mark $\to$ 200 Billion Marks.
People ordered two beers at once because the second would perform price rise while drinking the first.
Ended by "Rentenmark" (backed by land). Restoration of Trust.

**Exercise 2 (Modern Monetary Theory critique):**
MMT says Taxes drive money demand.
In Hyperinflation, nobody pays taxes.
So money has no value.
Constraint is real.
