# Debt Sustainability: The $r-g$ Dynamic

## I. Executive Summary

Sovereign Debt is sustainable if the Debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes or falls over time. This depends critically on the relationship between the real interest rate paid on debt ($r$) and the real growth rate of the economy ($g$). If $r < g$, a government can run a primary deficit forever and still debt-inflate its way to solvency. If $r > g$, the debt creates a "Snowball Effect" leading to default or hyperinflation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Debt Dynamics Equation)
$$\Delta b_t = (r_t - g_t)b_{t-1} - s_t$$
-   $b_t$: Debt-to-GDP ratio.
-   $r_t$: Real effective interest rate.
-   $g_t$: Real GDP growth.
-   $s_t$: Primary Budget Surplus (Rev - Spend, excluding interest).

### Definition 2.2 (The Trap)
If $r > g$ (e.g., Italy in 2011: Rates 7%, Growth 0%), the debt grows automatically ($7\% \times 130\% = 9\%$ increase).
To stabilize, the country must run a huge Primary Surplus ($s_t > 9\%$).
But Austerity kills Growth ($g \downarrow$).
The denominator shrinks faster than the numerator. Debt Ratio RISES despite austerity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Ponzi Games
Is the US Government a Ponzi scheme?
Technically, if it strictly pays old debt with new debt.
Allowed ONLY if $r < g$ continuously.
This is why "Financial Repression" (keeping $r$ low) is an existential necessity for high-debt states.

### 3.2 The Doom Loop
Rise in Sovereign Yields $\to$ Banks (holding bonds) lose capital $\to$ Credit Crunch $\to$ Recession ($g \downarrow$) $\to$ Deficit rises $\to$ Yields rise further.
ECB "OMT" (Outright Monetary Transactions) was created to break this loop.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 CDS Trading (Credit Default Swaps)
Buy Sovereign CDS when $r$ approaches $g$.
Sign of Distress: 10Y Yield > Nominal GDP Growth.
If US Nominal Growth is 4% and 10Y Yield hits 5%, US Debt is on an explosive path.

### 4.2 Safe Haven Status
Why can Japan have 250% Debt/GDP?
Because they borrow in their own currency (Yen) and hold the debt domestically.
$r$ is 0.1%. $g$ is 0.5%.
Equation holds.
Beware sovereigns borrowing in Foreign Currency ($r$ is determined by the Fed, not them).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Italy vs Greece):**
Greece defaulted because it couldn't print Euros.
If Greece had Drachma, it would have devalued (Inflation) instead of Defaulting.
Sovereign Risk in fiat currency $\approx$ Inflation Risk.
Sovereign Risk in foreign currency $\approx$ Default Risk.

**Exercise 2 (The Threshold):**
Is 90% Debt/GDP the tipping point? (Reinhart-Rogoff).
Debunked.
Japan (250%) is fine. Argentina (50%) defaults.
Credibility matters more than Ratio.
