# Water Rights Trading: Blue Gold

## I. Executive Summary

**Water Markets** treat water as a tradeable asset, decoupling land ownership from water access. The **Murray-Darling Basin (Australia)** is the gold standard of efficiency (Spot + Perm rights). In the US, the **Colorado River Compact** is failing, leading to nascent markets like the Nasdaq Veles Water Index (NQH2O). Scarcity drives the thesis: Water is the only commodity with no substitute.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Water Rights)
-   **Riparian:** Tied to land next to river (Eastern US). Hard to trade.
-   **Prior Appropriation:** "First in time, first in right" (Western US). Senior rights get 100% allocation; Junior rights get 0% in drought.
-   **Shares/Allocations:** Australia model. Tradable entitlement.

### Definition 2.2 (The Buy-and-Dry)
Cities (Municipalities) buy farms just for the water rights.
Stop farming ("Dry up").
Pipe water to city.
Socio-economic ghost towns left behind.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Inelastic Demand (Urban vs Ag)
Farmers demand is elastic (At high price, fallow field).
City demand is inelastic (People must drink).
Price clears at City willingness to pay.
Cities effectively subsidize farmers to stop farming.

### 3.2 Virtual Water
Trading Food = Trading Water.
Alfalfa exports from Arizona to Saudi Arabia.
Saudi bans Alfalfa farming (save water). Buys Arizona land to pump aquifer free.
"Exporting water in the form of hay."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Asset Play
Buy farmland with Senior Water Rights in California.
Option value of water > Crop yield.
Hedge Funds accumulating acreage in the West.

### 4.2 Desalination Cap
Price of Water capped by Desalination Cost ($\approx$ $2000/acre-foot).
If Market Price > Desal, build plant.
Currently, Ag water trade at $200-$500.
Long way to go before Desal cap is hit for agriculture.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Australia Drought 2019):**
Spot Water Price hit $1000/ML.
Dairy farmers sold water rights (Made more money selling water than milk).
Cotton farmers stopped planting.
Market efficiently allocated scarce resource to highest value use (Almonds/Grapes).

**Exercise 2 (The Big Short - Burry):**
Michael Burry focused on Water.
Buying almonds?
"Food is the way to invest in water."
Direct water trading is legally difficult; embedded water is easy.
