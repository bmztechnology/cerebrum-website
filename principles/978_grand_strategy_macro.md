# Grand Strategy Macro

## I. Executive Summary

**Grand Strategy** in finance integrates **Geopolitics**, **Demographics**, **Technology**, and **Monetary Cycles** into a cohesive worldview. Unlike a "Trade" (Short-term), a Grand Strategy defines the **decadal allocation**. Currently, the Grand Strategy is shifting from **Globalization/Disinflation** (1980-2020) to **Fragmentation/Inflation** (2020-?).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Long Cycle - Dalio)
80-100 year Debt Cycle.
Phase 1: Hard Money, Low Debt. Prosperity.
Phase 2: Paper Money, Rising Debt. Bubble.
Phase 3: Massive Debt, Printing Money, Conflict. (We are here).
Phase 4: Reset (Default/Devaluation).
Allocation MUST change based on the Phase.
Phase 1 allocation: Equities. Phase 3 allocation: Gold/Commodities.

### Definition 2.2 (The Fourth Turning Portfolio)
Crisis Era Portfolio.
Correlation between Stocks and Bonds turns positive (Both fall).
Need "Third Pillar": Real Assets.
Cash is trash (Real rates negative).
Volatility is high.
Strategy: Survival first, Profit second.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Dollar Smile Theory
USD rises when US growth is > RoW (Risk On).
USD rises when Global Crisis occurs (Risk Off).
USD falls when US growth slows + Global growth rises (Goldilocks).
Grand Strategy: Are we in the left or right tail of the smile?
Currently: Right tail (Crisis/High Rates).

### 3.2 The Energy Transition
Physical Reality vs Political Ambition.
Target: Net Zero.
Constraint: Physics.
Result: Chronic underinvestment in Fossil Fuels $\implies$ Energy Inflation $\implies$ Secular Inflation.
Long "Old Energy" as a cash cow; Long "New Energy" as a tech bet.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Barbell Strategy
90% Safe Assets (T-Bills, Gold).
10% Hyper-Aggressive (Crypto, VC, Far OTM Options).
Avoid the Middle (Corporate Bonds, Value Stocks).
The Middle gets crushed in a Crisis.
The Barbell survives (Safe) and captures convexity (Aggressive).

### 4.2 Geopolitical Hedge
Don't put all capital in one jurisdiction.
"Jurisdictional Diversification."
US Stocks. Swiss Gold. Singapore Cash. Caribbean Real Estate?
The ultimate hedge against Sovereign Risk.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Scenario Planning):**
Scenario A: Tech Deflation wins (AI). Stocks $\uparrow$.
Scenario B: Debt Monetization wins (Inflation). Gold $\uparrow$.
Scenario C: War. Oil $\uparrow$.
Construct a portfolio that survives A, B, and C.
The "Cockroach Portfolio."

**Exercise 2 (The 60/40 Death):**
2022 was the worst year for 60/40 in a century.
Why? Inflation broke the bond hedge.
Grand Strategy: Replace the 40 (Bonds) with Trend Following / Commodities?
