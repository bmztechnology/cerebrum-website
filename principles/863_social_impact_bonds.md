# Social Impact Bonds Pay for Success

## I. Executive Summary

**Social Impact Bonds (SIBs)** are contracts where private investors fund social interventions (e.g., reducing recidivism), and the Government pays a return **if and only if** specific outcomes are achieved. It transfers **Performance Risk** from tax-payers to investors. Microstructure relies on the **Evaluator** (Referee) and rigorous **Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Pay-for-Success Structure)
1. **Commissioner:** Gov (wants outcome).
2. **Provider:** NGO (delivers service).
3. **Investor:** Goldman Sachs (provides upfront cash).
4. **Evaluator:** Academic (measures result).
Outcomes Outcome outcome > Target $\implies$ Investor gets Principal + 10%.
Outcome < Target $\implies$ Investor loses Principal.

### Definition 2.2 (Cost Aversion)
Gov pays only out of *savings*.
Example: Prisoner costs \$50k/year.
Recidivism reduction saves \$5M.
Gov pays Investors \$2M. Nets \$3M.
Arbitrage of social inefficiency.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Measurement Risk
"Creaming."
Provider targets the easiest cases to ensure success.
"Parking."
SIBs must be designed to prevent gaming.
RCT (Randomized Control Trial) is the gold standard but expensive and slow.
"Historic Baseline" is cheaper but risky (Correlation vs Causation).

### 3.2 Scalability Issue
SIBs are bespoke. High transaction costs (Legal/Setup).
Average deal size \$10M.
Too small for Pension Funds.
Need for "Impact Rate Cards" (Standardized pricing for outcomes) to securitize the market.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Development Impact Bonds (DIBs)
Donor (Gates Foundation) pays outcome instead of Gov.
Used in Emerging Markets (Malaria reduction).
Transfers risk from Donor to Implementation Partner/Investor.

### 4.2 The Rikers Island Failure
Goldman invested to reduce teen recidivism at Rikers.
Program failed to hit target.
Goldman lost outcome outcomes outcome investment.
System worked? Taxpayers paid nothing for failure.
Moral hazard check: Did the failure deter future investment?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Pricing the Outcome):**
What is the value of a high school diploma?
Fiscal Proxy: Higher taxes paid + Lower welfare costs.
Social Benefit: Hard to price.
SIBs focus on Fiscal Proxy (Cashable Savings).

**Exercise 2 (Term Sheet Complexity):**
"Force Majeure."
Policy change (Govt changes law) makes outcome impossible.
Risk allocation.
Govt usually indemnifies "Political Risk," Investor takes "Operational Risk."
