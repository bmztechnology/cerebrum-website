# Average True Range (ATR): The Volatility Thermometer

## I. Executive Summary

The Average True Range (ATR) is a non-directional measure of volatility. Before Wilder, traders looked at "Range" ($High - Low$). Wilder realized this missed "Gaps." If a stock closes at 100 and opens at 110, the range of the second bar might be small ($111-109=2$), but the *True Range* is huge (11). ATR allows traders to normalize stops and targets based on the current market "Temperature."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (True Range - TR)
$$TR_t = \max[ (H_t - L_t), |H_t - C_{t-1}|, |L_t - C_{t-1}| ]$$
-   Term 1: Standard intraday range.
-   Term 2: Gap Up (High minus prev Close).
-   Term 3: Gap Down (Low minus prev Close).

### Definition 2.2 (ATR)
The smoothed moving average of TR (usually 14 periods).
$$ATR_t = \frac{ATR_{t-1} \times 13 + TR_t}{14}$$

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Normalization
ATR is accurate across assets.
-   Stock A Price \$10. ATR \$1. (10% Volatility).
-   Stock B Price \$100. ATR \$1. (1% Volatility).
Comparing raw dollar moves is useless. Comparing ATR-multiples ($1R, 2R$) allows for a universal trading framework.

### 3.2 Volatility Cycles
Market alternates between High and Low ATR.
-   Low ATR $\implies$ Compression $\implies$ Breakout.
-   High ATR $\implies$ Expansion $\implies$ Exhaustion.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Volatility-Adjusted Stops (The Chandelier Exit)
Stop Loss $= Entry - (2 \times ATR)$.
-   *Logic:* Random noise fluctuates within $1 ATR$. A move of $2 ATR$ suggests a structural change.
-   *Result:* Prevents being stopped out by noise.

### 4.2 Position Sizing
Fixed Fractional Risk ($R$).
$$Units = \frac{Account \times Risk\%}{N \times ATR}$$
This ensures that you buy *fewer* units of a volatile asset and *more* units of a quiet asset, equalizing the dollar risk.

### 4.3 Breakout Confirmation
Price breaks resistance.
Check ATR.
-   If ATR is rising: Valid Breakout (Energy expanding).
-   If ATR is falling: False Breakout (Lack of interest).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Calculation of TR):**
Day 1 Close: 1.1000.
Day 2 High: 1.0950. Low: 1.0900.
(This is a gap down).
a) Term 1 ($H-L$): $0.0050$.
b) Term 2 ($|H-C_{prev}|$): $|1.0950 - 1.1000| = 0.0050$.
c) Term 3 ($|L-C_{prev}|$): $|1.0900 - 1.1000| = 0.0100$.
d) Max is 0.0100 (100 pips).
Note: The "Range" of the bar was 50 pips, but TR is 100 pips.

**Exercise 2 (Adaptation):**
Why should a scalper targets increase when ATR increases?
(If daily range is 200 pips, targeting 5 pips is inefficient. If daily range is 20 pips, targeting 5 pips is aggressive).

**Exercise 3 (Comparison):**
ATR vs Standard Deviation.
They are highly correlated ($\sigma \approx \text{smooth}(TR)$).
Why use ATR? (Easier to calculate mentally and handles gaps better in logic).
