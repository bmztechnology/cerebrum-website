# Investment Grade Wine and Whisky

## I. Executive Summary

Fine **Wine** (Bordeaux, Burgundy) and **Whisky** (Macallan, Karuizawa) improve with age, creating a natural **Time-Value** curve. Unlike financial options (Theta decay), these assets have **Theta Appreciation**. The microstructure relies on **Liv-ex** (The Fine Wine Exchange) for pricing and **Bonded Warehouses** (Octavian) for provenance and tax handling.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Vintner's Equation)
$$ Value(t) = Value(0) \times e^{(r+s)t} $$
$s$: Scarcity rate.
Consumption (drinking) reduces supply every year.
"The Inverse Production Function": Supply decreases as asset matures.
Demand rises as liquid improves.
Double Alpha.

### Definition 2.2 (En Primeur)
Wine Futures.
Buying the wine while it is still in the barrel (2 years before bottling).
Betting that: Bottled Price > (Barrel Price + Cost of Carry).
Recent years: En Primeur pricing has become "efficient" (High), reducing the arb.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Parker Effect
Critic Scores (Robert Parker).
Score 99 or 100 $\implies$ Price triples.
Score 89 $\implies$ Unsellable.
Market is highly sensitive to "Oracle" ratings.
Shift from Parker to "Crowd Scores" (Vivino/CellarTracker) democratizing taste.

### 3.2 Counterfeit Risk
Rudy Kurniawan.
Filling empty Romanee Conti bottles with cheap Pinot Noir.
Microstructure response: Bubble tags, NFC chips, Blockchain provenance (Everledger).
"Prooftag" seals.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Burgundy Shift
China market moved from Bordeaux (Mass produced) to Burgundy (Tiny production).
Prices of DRC (Domaine de la Romanée-Conti) exploded.
Supply constraint: DRC produces 6000 bottles. Cannot scale.
Perfect inelastic supply.

### 4.2 Whisky Cask Investment
Buying casks.
Bottling them after 10-20 years.
"Angels' Share": Evaporation (2% per year).
If cask drops below 40% ABV, it's not whisky. (Zero value).
Risk of "Over-aging" (Woody taste).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Liv-ex 100 Index):**
Correlation with Luxury Stocks (LVMH).
Correlation with Inflation.
Wine performed well in the 1970s stagflation.
Real Asset.

**Exercise 2 (Tax Arbitrage):**
UK: Wine is a "Wasting Chattel."
Capital Gains Tax free?
Tax microstructure determines jurisdiction of storage.
