# Endowment Effect Status Quo Bias

## I. Executive Summary

The **Endowment Effect** is the hypothesis that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This is an extension of **Loss Aversion** (giving up the object feels like a loss). It leads to the **Status Quo Bias**: the strong preference for the current state of affairs. In finance, this causes **Portfolio Inertia** (Holding legacy positions, failing to rebalance) and **Low Turnover** in bad assets.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (WTA vs WTP)
**WTP (Willingness to Pay):** Price to acquire mug (\$5).
**WTA (Willingness to Accept):** Price to sell mug (\$10).
WTA / WTP ratio $\approx 2$.
Market liquidity depends on the gap closing.

### Definition 2.2 (Status Quo Bias)
Samuelson & Zeckhauser (1988).
Given a choice between Default Option and New Option.
Overwhelming preference for Default.
"Checking the box to opt-out" is hard.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Inertia of 401ks
Participants rarely change allocations.
Default fund (Money Market vs Target Date) determines wealth.
"Set it and forget it" is a double-edged sword.
Passivity helps avoid overtrading, but hurts if asset allocation is wrong.

### 3.2 Inheritance
Heirs rarely sell inherited stock.
"Grandpa bought GE in 1950."
Emotional attachment (Endowment) + Tax reasons (Step up basis).
Result: Massive single stock concentration risk.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Rebalancing Test
"If you had cash today, would you buy this asset at this price?"
If "No" $\implies$ Sell.
Overcoming Endowment Effect by resetting to "Cash state" mentally.

### 4.2 Marketing Free Trials
"Try it for 30 days."
Once you have it (Endowment), it's hard to give back.
Netflix subscription inertia.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Mug Experiment):**
Classroom setting.
Half get mugs. Market opens.
Volume of trade is low. Prices stay high.
Kills the Coase Theorem (allocation efficiency).

**Exercise 2 (Regret Avoidance):**
Selling and seeing it go up is Regret (Commission).
Holding and seeing it go down is Bad Luck (Omission).
People prefer errors of Omission to Commission.
Status Quo minimizes Commission error.
