# Representativeness Heuristic Gambler's Fallacy

## I. Executive Summary

**Representativeness** is the tendency to classify objects based on their similarity to a prototype, ignoring base rates. It leads to **Stereotyping** in markets (e.g., "Good Company = Good Stock"). A key sub-bias is the **Gambler's Fallacy**: the belief that random processes self-correct in the short run (e.g., "Red came up 5 times, Black is due"). This contradicts independence of events.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Similarity > Probability)
Linda Problem (Kahneman).
Is Linda a "Bank Teller" or a "Feminist Bank Teller"?
People choose the latter because she *resembles* a feminist.
Statistically, $P(A \cap B) \le P(A)$. Conjunction Fallacy.
Investors prefer "Tech Growth Stock with AI Story" over just "Stock."

### Definition 2.2 (Law of Small Numbers)
Belief that small samples must represent the population parameters.
"Fund manager beat market 3 years in a row."
Conclusion: "He is skilled."
Reality: Look at $N=1000$ managers, random chance creates streaks.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Gambler's Fallacy vs Hot Hand
**Gambler's Fallacy:** Mean Reversion expectation in IID processes. (Roulette).
**Hot Hand Fallacy:** Trend expectation in IID processes?
In markets:
"Price is up 5 days, must go down" (Gambler's - Top Picking).
"Price is up 5 days, must be momentum" (Hot Hand - Trend Following).
Which is right? Depends on auto-correlation of the asset.

### 3.2 Good Company Implies Good Stock
prototype: "Google is a great company."
Inference: "Investing in Google is a great idea."
Neglects Price. If P/E is 100x, it's a bad investment.
Solvency $\neq$ Valuation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 IPO Hype
Investors judge new IPO based on resemblance to recent successful IPOs.
"The next Amazon."
Base rate of IPOs is underperformance.

### 4.2 Mean Reversion Trading
Betting on Gambler's Fallacy being true?
If market is overextended (RSI > 90), probability of reversal increases (not independent).
In markets, events are NOT independent (Feedback loops), so Gambler's Fallacy is not always a fallacy.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Sample Size):**
Manager returns: +20%, +20%, +20%.
Skill?
Need to see performance in Down Market.
"A rising tide lifts all boats."
Don't judge based on a small, biased sample.

**Exercise 2 (Cluster Illusion):**
Seeing patterns in random charts.
"Head and Shoulders."
Pareidolia.
Humans are pattern recognition machines in a noisy world.
