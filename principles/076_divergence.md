# Divergence: The Discrepancy Signal

## I. Executive Summary

Divergence occurs when the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a technical indicator (usually a momentum oscillator like RSI, MACD, or OBV). It represents a crack in the market's facade. While price tells you *what* is happening (e.g., New High), the indicator tells you the *quality* of that action (e.g., Lower Momentum). Divergence is a leading indicator of trend reversal or continuation, relying on the physics principle that momentum change precedes velocity change.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Regular/Classic Divergence)
Used to predict **Trend Reversals**.
-   **Bearish Divergence:** Price makes Higher High ($HH$) while Indicator makes Lower High ($LH$).
    -   *Logic:* Bulls are pushing price up, but with less enthusiasm/volume.
-   **Bullish Divergence:** Price makes Lower Low ($LL$) while Indicator makes Higher Low ($HL$).
    -   *Logic:* Bears are pushing price down, but selling pressure is drying up.

### Definition 2.2 (Hidden Divergence)
Used to predict **Trend Continuation**.
-   **Bearish Hidden:** Trend is Down. Price pulls back to a Lower High ($LH$), but Indicator marks a Higher High ($HH$).
    -   *Logic:* Indicator is "overbought" even though price didn't reach the previous peak. Weak rally.
-   **Bullish Hidden:** Trend is Up. Price pulls back to a Higher Low ($HL$), but Indicator marks a Lower Low ($LL$).
    -   *Logic:* Indicator is "oversold" rapidly while price structure holds firm. Strong support.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Spring Analogy
Momentum is like a spring.
-   In a healthy trend, Price Extension $\propto$ Momentum Extension.
-   In Divergence, Price extends ($P \uparrow$) but Spring does not ($M \downarrow$).
-   Result: The "Snap Back" (Mean Reversion) is inevitable.

### 3.2 Volume Divergence (OBV)
Price rising on falling volume is the most fundamental divergence.
$$P \uparrow, Vol \downarrow \implies \text{Lack of Participation}$$
It creates a "Vacuum Top" which can collapse rapidly as there is no structural support (Volume nodes) beneath.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The "Three Drive" Filter
Divergence often fails on the first signal (e.g., RSI Divergence at High 2).
Wait for **Three Drives**:
High 1, High 2 (Div), High 3 (Triple Div).
*Probability:* Probability of reversal increases exponentially with sequential divergences.

### 4.2 Multi-Indicator Confirmation
If RSI shows divergence, check MACD Histogram and OBV.
If all 3 diverge, the signal is "Grade A."
If only RSI diverges but OBV makes new high, ignore (Price is supported by Volume).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Identification):**
Trend: Downtrend.
Price Low A: 1.1000. RSI: 30.
Price rallies to 1.1050.
Price drops to Low B: 1.0950. RSI: 35.
a) Is this Divergence?
b) Which type? (Regular Bullish).
c) What is the trade? (Long reversal).

**Exercise 2 (Hidden Logic):**
Trend: Uptrend.
Price corrects from 100 to 90. RSI drops from 70 to 40.
Price rallies to 110. RSI goes to 75.
Price corrects to 95. RSI drops to 35.
Analysis: Price made Higher Low (95 > 90). RSI made Lower Low (35 < 40).
What does this indicate? (Hidden Bullish Divergence - Buy the Dip).

**Exercise 3 (Failure):**
Why does Divergence fail in "Parabolic Moves"? (The indicator flattens at 100/0 while price keeps doubling. "The market can remain irrational longer than...").
