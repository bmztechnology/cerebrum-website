# Reserve Accumulation Theory: The War Chest

## I. Executive Summary

After the Asian Financial Crisis (1997), Emerging Markets decided "Never Again." They began massively accumulating **Foreign Exchange Reserves** (mostly USD Treasuries) as self-insurance against capital flight. This created the **Global Savings Glut**, depressing US yields and fueling the 2008 Housing Bubble. China's $3 Trillion pile is the ultimate manifestation of this "Mercantilist Precaution."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Guidotti-Greenspan Rule)
Reserves should equal Short-Term External Debt (1-year maturity).
Ensures country can survive a 1-year total cutoff from credit markets.
Most EMs now aim for $Reserves > 150\%$ of Guidotti-Greenspan.

### Definition 2.2 (Sterilized Intervention)
To build reserves, Central Bank Sells Domestic Currency / Buys USD.
This keeps Domestic Currency undervalued (Export subsidy).
"Neo-Mercantilism."
Result: Chronic Current Account Surpluses.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Bernoulli's Paradox
Why do poor countries (China) lend to rich countries (USA) at low rates (Treasuries)?
Capital should flow Rich $\to$ Poor (High Yield).
Reason: **Safety**.
EMs prioritize Return *of* Capital over Return *on* Capital.
Reserves are "Collateral" for globalization participation.

### 3.2 Secular Stagnation Link
Reserve Accumulation $\implies$ High Demand for Safe Assets (Treasuries).
Yields fall ($r^* \downarrow$).
Cheap Money fuels speculation in the West.
Imbalance: East produces/saves, West consumes/borrows.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 FX Valuation (The Burn Rate)
In a crisis, don't look at Total Reserves.
Look at "Burn Rate" (How fast they are spending to defend currency).
If Burn Rate implies $< 6$ months runway $\implies$ Short Currency massively.
Case: Russia 2014, Turkey 2020.

### 4.2 Diversification
China realizing $3T in USD is a geopolitical vulnerability (Sanctions).
Shifting to Gold, Commodities, Strategic Assets (Belt and Road).
This reduces structural demand for Treasuries $\implies$ Higher US Yields long-term.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Japan):**
$1.2 Trillion Reserves.
Uses it to suppress JPY appreciation historically.
Now using it to suppress JPY depreciation.
Reserves are a dual-use buffer.

**Exercise 2 (Cost of Carrying):**
Holding $100B in Treasuries yielding 2%.
Domestic Bonds yield 8%.
"Quasi-fiscal Cost" = 6% per year on $100B = $6B loss.
Insurance is expensive.
