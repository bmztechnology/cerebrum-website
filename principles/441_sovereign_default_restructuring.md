# Sovereign Default Restructuring: Holdouts

## I. Executive Summary

**Sovereign Default** is a messy legal and economic process. Unlike companies, countries cannot be liquidated. Restructuring involves exchanging old bonds for new ones with a "Haircut" (Face Value reduction) or "Extensions" (Maturity lengthening). **Holdout Creditors** (Vulture Funds) refuse to participate, suing for full payment and seizing sovereign assets abroad, creating a blockade to normalization.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Pari Passu)
"Equal Step."
Clause: "Bonds rank equally with all other unsecured debt."
Interpretation (Judge Griesa / Argentina): You cannot pay the Exchange Bondholders (who accepted a haircut) unless you *also* pay the Holdouts (who demand 100%) pro-rata.
Effective injunction blocking payment system.

### Definition 2.2 (Exit Yield)
Yield of the New Bonds upon trading.
Determines the NPV of the offer.
Haircut = $1 - \frac{NPV}{Face_{Old}}$.
High Exit Yield $\implies$ Low NPV $\implies$ High Haircut.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Prisoner's Dilemma
Collective Action problem.
If everyone agrees to haircut, country recovers, bonds rally.
If I hold out while you agree, I might get 100% (Free Rider).
If everyone holds out, country stays in default, everyone gets 0.

### 3.2 Reputation vs Relief
Why repay? To access capital markets again.
"Reputational Theory of Sovereign Debt."
Defaults bar re-entry for 3-5 years.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Exchange Offer
"Take it or Leave it."
Sweeteners: Upfront Cash, GDP Warrants.
Threats: "If you don't accept, we will never pay you."

### 4.2 Asset Seizure
Holdouts try to attach assets: Presidential Plane, Naval Ship (ARA Libertad), Central Bank Reserves.
Sovereign Immunity laws (FSIA in US) protect most assets.
Identifying "Commercial Activity" assets is the game.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Litigation Finance):**

Fund 10 years of lawsuits.
Payoff 10x or 0x.

**Exercise 2 (GDP Warrants):**
Issued by Argentina/Ukraine/Greece.
Pay extra if GDP Growth > Threshold.
"Equity Kicker" for Sovereigns.
Hard to value. Often mispriced.
