# Satisficing vs Maximizing

## I. Executive Summary

**Satisficing** (Simon) is the strategy of accepting the first option that meets a threshold (Good returns, reasonable risk). **Maximizing** is the relentless search for the *absolute best* option (The perfect stock, the perfect entry). Paradoxically, Maximizers tend to achieve better objective outcomes but feel **Worse** subjective well-being (Regret, Anxiety). In trading, "Perfect is the enemy of Profit."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stopping Rule)
Search costs $C$. Expected Improvement $I$.
Stop when $E[I] < C$.
Maximizer assumes $C \approx 0$ (Search is free/worth it).
Satisficer assumes $C$ is high.

### Definition 2.2 (The Paradox of Choice)
Schwartz.
More options $\implies$ More Maximizing pressure $\implies$ Analysis Paralysis.
ETF universe (3000 ETFs) paralyzes investors compared to old days (3 stocks).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Trading Entry
Maximizer: "I need to buy at the exact bottom." Misses the trade.
Satisficer: "Price is fair. I buy." Catches the trend.
Mean Reversion requires Maximizing (Sniper).
Trend Following requires Satisficing (Shotgun).

### 3.2 Happiness Gap
Maximizers continually compare realized outcome with counterfactuals.
"I made 20%, but I could have made 25% if I waited."
Satisficer: "I made 20%. Great."
Long term sustainability favors the Satisficer.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Automated Execution
VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price).
A satisficing algo.
"Get me the average price of the day."
Don't try to beat the market, just match the flow.
Accepted by institutions as "Good Enough."

### 4.2 Portfolio Size
Maximizer: Holds 50 stocks (fearing missing the best one).
Satisficer: Holds 10 stocks.
Complexity cost.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Secretary Problem):**
Optimal stopping rule ($37\%$).
Look at first 37% of options, reject all. Then pick the next one better than the best seen so far.
Mathematically optimal satisficing.

**Exercise 2 (Regret Calibration):**
Maximizers feel regret even when winning.
Journaling "Satisfaction" vs "PnL."
Learning to accept "Leaving money on the table" as the cost of doing business.
