# Commitment of Traders COT: Smart Money Tracking

## I. Executive Summary

The **Commitment of Traders (COT)** report, published weekly by the CFTC, breaks down Open Interest in US Futures into categories: **Commercials** (Hedgers/Smart Money), **Non-Commercials** (Large Speculators/Funds), and **Non-Reportable** (Small Retail). Analyzing the positioning of these groups provides clues about potential market turning points and sentiment extremes.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Categories)
-   **Commercials (Hedgers):** Producers/Users. Usually counter-trend. (Miners sell into rallies). Positioning often Net Short (Producers) or Net Long (Consumers).
-   **Non-Commercials (Large Specs):** Trend Followers. Usually with the trend. Max Long at tops. Max Short at bottoms.
-   **Small Specs:** Retail. Often wrong at extremes.

### Definition 2.2 (COT Index)
Normalize the data.
$Index = 100 \times \frac{Current - Min_{52w}}{Max_{52w} - Min_{52w}}$.
Buying signal: Commercials at Max Long (100).
Selling signal: Commercials at Max Short (0).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Keynesian Normal Backwardation
Hedgers pay Speculators to take risk.
Therefore, Hedgers are usually "Wrong" on marked-to-market PnL?
No, they are hedged physically.
Speculators capture the risk premium.
Net Long Spec position is standard state.

### 3.2 Crowded Trades
When Speculators are "All in" (Historical extreme Long).
No one left to buy.
Market is vulnerable to correction.
"Sentiment Indicator."
Commercials are the "Valuation Anchor."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Gold Trading
Commercials (Miners) are ALWAYS Net Short (Selling future production).
Look for "Less Short than usual."
If Commercials go Net Long, it is a massive bullish signal (Miners holding inventory).
Rare event.

### 4.2 TFF Report (Traders in Financial Futures)
Newer format.
Separates "Asset Managers" (Real Money) from "Leveraged Funds" (Hedge Funds).
Hedge Funds are the "Smart Speculators."
Asset Managers are slow moving.
Watch for divergence between Asset Managers and Leveraged Funds.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Flip):**
Specs flip from Net Long to Net Short.
Trend change confirmation.
Usually happens *after* the price turn (Lagged data).
Report released Friday, data from Tuesday. 3-day lag.

**Exercise 2 (Open Interest Analysis):**
Price Up + OI Up = Bullish (New money).
Price Up + OI Down = Bearish (Short covering).
Price Down + OI Up = Bearish (New shorts).
Price Down + OI Down = Bullish (Long liquidation near end).
Combine with COT.
