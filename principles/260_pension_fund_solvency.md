# Pension Fund Solvency: The Time Bomb

## I. Executive Summary

**Pension Funds** are the largest asset allocators in the world. They face a solvency crisis: **Assets < Liabilities**. Liabilities (future payouts) are calculated by discounting cash flows. When interest rates were zero, liabilities exploded. Now that rates are high, assets (Bonds/Stocks) have fallen. The **LDI (Liability Driven Investment)** crisis in the UK (2022) revealed the hidden leverage in this staid sector.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Funding Ratio)
$$Ratio = \frac{\text{Fair Value of Planned Assets}}{\text{Present Value of Liabilities}}$$
-   Discount Rate: The critical variable.
-   If Rate = 1%, Liability = $100M.
-   If Rate = 5%, Liability = $60M.
High Rates *help* solvency (mathematically), but *hurt* asset prices.

### Definition 2.2 (LDI Strategies)
Funds use Derivatives (Swaps) to match the duration of liabilities (30 years) without tying up all capital in Bonds.
Leverage: 1:4.
Goal: Hedge interest rate risk.
Risk: Margin Call if rates spike too fast (Gilts 2022).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Return Assumptions
US Public Pensions (CalPERS) assume 7-8% annual return.
Risk Free Rate was 0%.
To get 8%, they moved into Private Equity, Venture Capital, and Leverage.
"Reach for Yield."
If they miss 8%, taxpayers must fill the hole.

### 3.2 The Denominator Effect
Public Markets crash (Stocks -20%). Private Markets (PE) are "marked to model" (lagged).
Suddenly, PE is 40% of the portfolio (Target 20%).
Fund is "Overweight Illiquids."
Must sell Liquid Assets (Stocks/Bonds) to rebalance.
Negative feedback loop for markets.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The UK Gilt Crisis
Truss Budget spike Yields.
LDI Funds got margin called on Swaps.
Had to sell Gilts to pay margin.
Selling Gilts spiked yields more.
Doom Loop.
BOE intervened to buy Gilts.
Lesson: Pensions are systemically important.

### 4.2 Corporate Earnings Drag
Companies with Defined Benefit plans (old auto/industrial).
If Pension is underfunded, they must channel Free Cash Flow to the Pension, not Dividends/Buybacks.
General Electric (GE) was zombie-fied by its pension deficit for years.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Social Security):**
Pay-As-You-Go system. Not pre-funded.
Current workers pay current retirees.
Demographics (Dependency Ratio) kill the math.
Benefit cuts or Tax hikes are inevitable.

**Exercise 2 (Spying on CalPERS):**
CalPERS discloses portfolio.
If they decide to cut "Hedge Funds," the Hedge Fund industry suffers outflows.
They are the "Market Makers" of the alternative investment world.
