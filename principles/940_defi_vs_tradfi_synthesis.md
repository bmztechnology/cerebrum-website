# DeFi vs TradFi Synthesis

## I. Executive Summary

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** and **Traditional Finance (TradFi)** are converging. TradFi brings **Liquidity**, **Regulation**, and **Real World Assets (RWA)**. DeFi brings **Atomic Settlement**, **Transparency**, and **Composability**. The future is likely a **Hybrid System**: Regulated institutions trading tokenized assets on permissioned blockchains.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trust Spectrum)
TradFi: Trust the Intermediary (Bank/DTCC). "Too Big to Fail."
DeFi: Trust the Code (Smart Contract). "Code is Law."
Hybrid: Trust the Code, verified by the Intermediary.
Example: JPMorgan Onyx (Permissioned Chain).

### Definition 2.2 (Composability - Money Legos)
TradFi: Siloed. Schwab account cannot interact with Fidelity account easily.
DeFi: Global State.
You can lend Token A on Aave, take Token B, put it in Uniswap, and stake the LP token in Curve.
Instant, permissionless innovation.
Risk: "Contagion Composability" (One Lego breaks, the tower falls).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Institutional DeFi
Project Guardian (Singapore).
Banks trading FX swaps on Polygon.
Using Verifiable Credentials (KYC) to gate access to the pool.
The liquidity of DeFi rails + The compliance of TradFi.
"The Mullet": DeFi in the back (Tech), Fintech in the front (UX/Compliance).

### 3.2 Real World Assets (RWA)
Tokenizing T-Bills (Ondo Finance).
Bring the 5% Risk-Free Rate onto the blockchain.
Collateralize DeFi with real assets, not just volatile crypto.
Stabilizes yields.
Links the two economies.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Exchange Dilemma
FTX (Centralized Exchange) failed due to opacity.
Uniswap (DEX) succeeded due to transparency.
But Uniswap has slippage/MEV.
Future: CEXs proving reserves on-chain?
Or DEXs getting faster (L2s)?

### 4.2 Automated Market Making (AMM) vs Order Book
TradFi uses Order Books (CLOB) + Market Makers.
DeFi pioneered AMMs ($x \cdot y = k$).
AMMs are capital inefficient but 24/7 and passive.
Convergence: Uniswap v4 (Concentrated Liquidity) looks like an Order Book.
TradFi starting to use AMM concepts for illiquid bonds?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Stablecoin Bank Run):**
USDC depegged when SVB failed.
TradFi risk infected DeFi.
Irony: Crypto was meant to hedge TradFi.
Integration implies Correlation.

**Exercise 2 (Yield Stripping):**
Pendle Finance.
Separate Principal and Yield tokens.
TradFi concept (STRIPS) applied to Crypto Yields.
Sophisticated interest rate derivatives on chain.
