# Longevity Swaps and Pension De-Risking

## I. Executive Summary

**Longevity Risk** is the risk that pensioners live longer than expected, bankrupting **Defined Benefit (DB)** plans. **Longevity Swaps** allow Pension Funds to transfer this risk to Reinsurers. The Pension Fund pays a **Fixed Stream** (Expected Payout), and the Reinsurer pays the **Floating Stream** (Actual Payout). This creates a hedge against medical advances extending life.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Swap Structure)
Leg 1 (Pension pays): Expected Benefits + Fee (Risk Premium).
Leg 2 (Reinsurer pays): Actual Benefits.
Net Settlement.
Assets remain with Pension Fund (Collateralized).
Counterparty Risk managed via daily margining.

### Definition 2.2 (Buy-In vs Buy-Out)
**Buy-In (Swap):** Pension keeps assets/liabilities on balance sheet. Just a hedge.
**Buy-Out:** Transfer assets/liabilities entirely to Insurer (e.g., Legal & General). Pension plan winds up. Insurer issues individual annuities to members.
"Pension Risk Transfer" (PRT).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Mortality Improvement Rate
Past trend: People live 2 years longer every decade.
Model: Lee-Carter.
Risk: "Cure for Cancer" or "Life Extension Tech."
Reinsurers differ on assumptions.
Pricing arbitrage available between Reinsurers' models.

### 3.2 Natural Hedge
Life Insurers hold Mortality Risk (Death = Loss).
Pension Funds hold Longevity Risk (Life = Loss).
Perfect Natural Hedge.
Insurers buy Longevity Swaps to neutralize their Mortality book.
Capital efficiency benefit (Solvency II).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Capital Relief
Corporations (General Motors, British Airways) carry massive pension deficits.
Weighs on stock price (Debt-like).
PRT deal removes liability.
Stock re-rates.
"De-risking" trade.

### 4.2 Index-Based Swaps
LLMA (Life & Longevity Markets Association).
Swap based on National Mortality Index (e.g., UK population) rather than specific scheme members.
Basis Risk: Pension members (Wealthy) live longer than Average population.
"Wealth Effect" in longevity.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (COVID Impact):**
Excess Mortality.
Pension liabilities *decreased* (Grim math).
Longevity Swap Reinsurers *profited* (paid out less).
Life Insurers *lost*.
Hedge worked.

**Exercise 2 (Collateral Drag):**
Pension must post collateral if Swap is OTM (i.e., People dying faster than expected).
Liquidity demand.
