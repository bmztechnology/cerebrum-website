# Migration Economics: The Labor Valve

## I. Executive Summary

**Migration** is the flow of labor from Logic A (Low Capital/Low Wage) to Logic B (High Capital/High Wage). Economically, it is a massive efficiency arbitrage. For the Host Country, it suppresses low-end wages but boosts GDP and solves demographic deficits. For the Home Country, **Remittances** provide a crucial forex lifeline, often exceeding FDI and Foreign Aid combined.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Remittance Multiplier)
Money sent home (Western Union).
goes directly to consumption (Food/School).
High MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume).
Key stabiliser for Philippines, Mexico, Egypt, Nepal.
"Counter-cyclical" (Migrants send *more* when Home is in crisis).

### Definition 2.2 (Brain Drain vs Gain)
-   **Drain:** Best Doctors/Engineers leave Nigeria for UK. Nigeria subsidizes UK education. Bad.
-   **Gain:** Diaspora creates trade networks. Returnees bring back know-how. (Taiwan/India Tech boom).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Borjas Model
Immigrants lower the wages of *substitutable* native workers (High School dropouts).
But raise the productivity of *complementary* native workers (Managers/Owners).
Net GDP Gain.
Distributional Conflict (Winners vs Losers).

### 3.2 The Lump of Labor Fallacy
Idea: "There is a fixed number of jobs. Immigrants take them."
False.
Immigrants consume (create demand) and start businesses (create supply).
However, in the short run (local area), frictional displacement is real.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Philippines Peso (PHP)
40% of FX reserves come from OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers).
PHP seasonality: Strong in December (Christmas remittances).
Resilient to Oil shocks because Migrants work in Oil states (Middle East). Hedge.

### 4.2 UK Brexit Labor Shock
Ended Free Movement.
Immediate shortage of Truck Drivers / Farm pickers.
Wages for these sectors spiked 20%.
Inflationary.
"You can't import the labor, so you must import the inflation."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Canada Strategy):**
Aggressive immigration targets (500k/year).
Aim: Solve aging population.
Side effect: Housing Crisis (Supply of houses inelastic vs Demand shock of people).
Long Real Estate / Short Affordability.

**Exercise 2 (Remittance Tech):**
Western Union vs Crypto (Bitcoin/Strike).
Fees: 7% vs 0.1%.
El Salvador adopted Bitcoin primarily to save 7% of GDP lost to remittance fees.
Disruptive potential.
