# Gold and Precious Metals Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

**Precious Metals** (Gold, Silver, Platinum) function as both **Industrial Inputs** and **Monetary Assets**. Gold is primarily a **Currency** (Store of Value) with zero yield, competing against Real Rates. Microstructure centers on the **LBMA** (London OTC) and **COMEX** (Futures), with arbitrage keeping the "Loco London" spot aligned with NY Futures. Silver trading is famous for its **Retail Squeezes** and Volatility.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Loco London)
Unallocated Gold accounts in London clearing banks (JPM, HSBC).
"Paper Gold" backed by fractional reserves?
Allocated: Physical bars with serial numbers. Storage fees apply.
Unallocated: General claim. No fees (Counterparty risk).

### Definition 2.2 (Gold Drivers)
$$ Price \propto \frac{liquidity}{Real Rates} $$
Correlates inversely with TIPS Real Yield.
If Real Rates $\uparrow$, Opportunity cost of holding Gold $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Price $\downarrow$.
Correlates with Central Bank Buying (China/Russia de-dollarization).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Silver's Dual Nature
50% Industrial (Solar panels, Electronics).
50% Monetary.
In Recession: Industrial demand drops (Bearish). Monetary demand rises (Safe Haven).
Net effect: Volatile.
Gold-Silver Ratio: Mean reverts around 60-80.
If > 100, Silver cheap.

### 3.2 EFP (Exchange for Physical)
Flow mechanism between Comex (Futures) and London (Spot).
Trader buys Future, exchanges for Spot position with Dealer.
EFP spreads blow out during logistics crises (COVID: planes grounded, couldn't fly bars to NY).
Price decoupling: NY Gold > London Gold.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Leasing and GOFO
Central Banks lend gold to earn yield (Lease Rate).
If Lease Rates are negative (GOFO positive), market is liquid.
If Lease Rates spike, physical shortage.

### 4.2 The Gamma Squeeze (Silver)
Banks act as Short Dealers (writing Calls).
Retail buys massive OTM Calls.
Banks must hedge (Buy Futures).
Price rises $\to$ More hedging.
Feb 2021 Silver Squeeze attempt. (Failed due to massive physical supply depth).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Paper to Physical Ratio):**
Claim: "100 paper ounces for every 1 real ounce."
Conspiracy or Fractional Banking?
Comex Deliverable stocks are visible.
Leverage exists, but "Run on Gold" requires breaking the Comex delivery mechanism.

**Exercise 2 (Platinum/Palladium):**
Catalytic Converters.
Palladium substituted Platinum when Plat got expensive.
Now Platinum substituting Palladium.
Auto-catalyst switching cycle drives the spread.
