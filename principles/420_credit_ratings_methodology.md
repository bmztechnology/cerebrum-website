# Credit Ratings Methodology: The Scorecard

## I. Executive Summary

Credit Ratings (S&P, Moody's, Fitch) assign an ordinal rank to default risk. The methodology combines **Quantitative Metrics** (Leverage, Coverage) with **Qualitative Factors** (Industry position, Management, Country Risk). While criticized for lagging the market, ratings determine the **Cost of Capital** and **Collateral Haircuts**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Key Ratios)
-   **Leverage:** Debt / EBITDA. (IG < 3.0x. HY > 5.0x).
-   **Interest Coverage:** EBITDA / Interest Expense. (IG > 8.0x. HY < 3.0x).
-   **FFO / Debt:** Funds From Operations / Total Debt. Cash flow focus.

### Definition 2.2 (Notching)
-   **Issuer Rating (CFR):** Probability of the company defaulting.
-   **Issue Rating:** Specific bond rating.
-   Senior Secured = CFR + 1 Notch.
-   Subordinated = CFR - 2 Notches.
Reflects recovery hierarchy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Through the Cycle (TTC)
Agencies aim for stable ratings.
Don't downgrade just because of 1 bad quarter.
Use "Normalized" earnings.
Market prices (Spreads) are "Point in Time" (PIT).
Market spreads widen *before* the downgrade.

### 3.2 The Sovereign Ceiling
Company usually cannot be rated higher than its country.
If Country defaults, it imposes capital controls / taxes.
Exceptions exist for global exporters with offshore cash (e.g., Brazilian commodity giants).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Rating Evaluation Service (RES)
Companies pay Agencies to simulate scenarios.
"If we acquire Competitor X with 50% debt, will we lose our A rating?"
Agencies give feedback.
M&A deals are structured to preserve ratings ("Rating Defense").

### 4.2 Credit Watch vs Outlook
-   **Outlook Negative:** 1-2 year horizon. 33% chance of downgrade.
-   **Watch Negative:** 90 day horizon. 50%+ chance of downgrade.
Traders short "Watch Negative" names.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Adjusted Debt):**
Agencies adjust reported debt.
Add: Pension Deficits, Operating Leases ($8 \times \text{Rent}$), Hybrid Equity credit (50% debt).
"True Leverage" is often higher than reported leverage.

**Exercise 2 (Split Ratings):**
Moody's Ba1. S&P BBB-.
"Split Junk."
Bond trades somewhere in between.
Included in IG indices? Usually requires 2 out of 3.
