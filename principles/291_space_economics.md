# Space Economics: The Orbital Economy

## I. Executive Summary

**Space Economics** is shifting from Government-led exploration to Private-led exploitation. Key drivers: **Launch Costs** (SpaceX Reusability), **Satellite Internet** (LEO Constellations), and potential **Asteroid Mining**. Who controls Low Earth Orbit (LEO) controls the future of global data and surveillance. We are witnessing the "closure of the frontier" in space.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cost to Orbit - LEO)
-   Space Shuttle: $18,000 / kg.
-   SpaceX Falcon 9: $2,700 / kg.
-   Starship (Proposed): $100 / kg.
Moore's Law for Space.
Enables business models that were previously impossible (Space Tourism, Manufacturing).

### Definition 2.2 (Kessler Syndrome)
Tragedy of the Commons in Orbit.
Debris hits Satellite $\to$ More Debris $\to$ Chain Reaction.
Orbit becomes unusable.
requires "Space Traffic Management" (Regulation).
Geopolitics: Who cleans up? Who pays?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Starlink Monopoly
Starlink (SpaceX) controls 50%+ of active satellites.
Military Utility: Demonstrated in Ukraine.
Diplomatic Power: Elon Musk decides if Ukraine has internet.
Private accumulation of sovereign power.

### 3.2 Asteroid Mining (Psyche 16)
Asteroid with $10 Quintillion of metals (Iron, Nickel, Platinum).
If mined, supply becomes infinite. Price $\to$ 0.
Disruption of terrestrial mining economies (South Africa, Russia).
Concept: Economic Scarcity is a terrestrial constraint, not a cosmic one.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Aerospace Defense
Space Force (US).
Anti-Satellite Weapons (ASAT).
Space is the new "High Ground."
Long Defense Contractors: Lockheed, Northrop, but increasingly pure-play: Rocket Lab.

### 4.2 GPS Dependency
Global Finance relies on GPS for *Timing* (Atomic Clocks).
HFT algos sync via GPS.
If GPS is jammed (Solar Flare or War).
Financial Markets halt.
Resilience: Quantum clocks?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Property Rights):**
Outer Space Treaty (1967). "No nukes, no sovereignty."
Artemis Accords (US led). "Safety Zones."
China constructing Lunar Base.
Race for water ice on Moon's South Pole.
First to extract sets the rules.

**Exercise 2 (Zero-G Manufacturing):**
Fiber Optics, Pharmaceuticals, Organs.
Higher quality when made in zero-g (No sedimentary defects).
Varda Space Industries.
Requires cheap return capability.
