# Reinsurance Cycles Hard vs Soft

## I. Executive Summary

The **Reinsurance Market** is fiercely cyclical, alternating between **Hard Markets** (Capital scarcity, high premiums, strict terms) and **Soft Markets** (Excess capital, low premiums, loose terms). The cycle is driven by **Catastrophes** (Capital destruction) and **Capital Inflows** (Yield seeking). Microstructure involves the **January 1st Renewals** (1/1) where the global price of risk is reset.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Combined Ratio)
$$ \text{Combined Ratio} = \frac{\text{Losses} + \text{Expenses}}{\text{Premiums}} $$
< 100%: Underwriting Profit.
> 100%: Underwriting Loss.
Soft Market: Ratios drift > 100% (relying on Investment Income).
Hard Market: Ratios snap < 80% (Pricing power returns).

### Definition 2.2 (Rate on Line - ROL)
Pricing metric for Excess of Loss (XoL) treaties.
$$ ROL = \frac{\text{Premium}}{\text{Limit}} $$
If you pay \$10M for \$100M coverage, ROL = 10%.
Payback Period = 1/ROL = 10 years.
If ROL doubles to 20% (Hard Market), Payback is 5 years.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Capital Cycle
1. Mega-Catastrophe (Hurricane Andrew). Capital wiped out.
2. Prices spike (Hard Market).
3. High ROE attracts new capital (Hedge Funds/PE).
4. Supply increases. Prices soften.
5. Soft Market (Race to the bottom).
6. Reserves weaken.
7. Next Mega-Cat or Reserve strengthening triggers Hard Market.

### 3.2 Social Inflation
Rising litigation costs.
Juries awarding nuclear verdicts (\>\$10M).
Impacts Casualty reinsurance (Liability) rather than Property.
"Long-tail" risk.
Requires increasing IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) reserves.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Retrocession Arbitrage
**Retrocession:** Reinsurance for Reinsurers.
Arbitrage: Buy Reinsurance cheap from primary market (Soft). Sell Retrocession expensive to panicked reinsurers (Hard)?
Or accumulate aggregate risk and hedge with ILS.
"Net Retained Line" management.

### 4.2 Start-up Class of [Year]
After every major Hurricane (1992, 2001, 2005), new Reinsurers launch in Bermuda.
"Class of 2023?"
Clean balance sheets (No legacy liabilities).
Advantage over incumbents who are digging out of holes.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The 1/1 Bluff):**
Brokers (Guy Carp/Aon) vs Reinsurers (Munich Re/Swiss Re).
Game of Chicken.
Who blinks first on price?
If Reinsurers hold the line ("No signature"), Cedants panic.
Hard Market discipline.

**Exercise 2 (Collateralized Re):**
Fronting.
Hedge Fund puts up 100% cash collateral.
Uses a "Fronting Carrier" (Rated A-) to issue the paper.
Bypasses the need for a rating.
Shadow Banking in insurance.
