# Shadow Banking Risks: The Unregulated Colossus

## I. Executive Summary

**Shadow Banking** refers to non-bank financial intermediaries (Hedge Funds, Money Market Funds, Repo Desks, Private Credit) that provide credit without access to Central Bank liquidity or deposit insurance. They engage in **Liquidity Transformation** (Short-term liabilities, Long-term assets). They are efficient but fragile, prone to "Runs" that require massive public bailouts (2008, 2020).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Run Mechanism)
Banks have FDIC Insurance. No runs.
Shadow Banks (e.g., MMF) promise $1.00 NAV.
Invest in Commercial Paper.
Crisis $\to$ Paper illiquid.
Investors panic redemption.
First mover advantage to run.
MMF "Breaks the Buck" ($0.97). Panic ensues.

### Definition 2.2 (Rehypothecation)
Collateral (Treasury Bond) is lent to Hedge Fund A $\to$ Posted to Dealer B $\to$ Lent to Fund C.
Collateral Velocity > 1.
"Collateral Chains."
If Dealer B fails, the single bond vanishes from A and C's balance sheet simultaneously.
"Ghost Liquidity."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regulatory Arbitrage
Why does Shadow Banking exist?
Basel III makes it expensive for Banks to lend (Capital Requirements).
Private Credit steps in.
Risk moves from Regulated (Viewable) to Unregulated (Opaque) sector.
Systemic Risk is conserved, not destroyed.

### 3.2 The March 2020 Treasury Crash
Foreign Central Banks + Hedge Funds (Basis Trade) sold Treasuries for cash.
Dealers couldn't absorb the volume (Regulations).
Treasury Market illiquid? The risk-free asset?
Fed had to buy $1 Trillion to save the Shadow system.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Basis Trade (Hedge Funds)
Long Treasury / Short Futures.
Leverage 50:1.
Profits from minute price difference.
If Repo rates spike, trade blows up.
Deleveraging shock hits markets.
Monitor: "Net Short Positions in Treasury Futures" (COT Report).

### 4.2 Private Credit Bubble?
Direct Lending to risky companies.
Marked-to-Model (Not Marked-to-Market).
Volatility laundering.
If Recession hits, Private Credit defaults will be the new Subprime.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Archegos):**
Family Office (Shadow Bank).
Total Return Swaps allowed massive leverage (5x) on Viacom/Discovery.
Stock dropped. Margin Call.
Fire sale wiped out $10B in days.
Banks (Credit Suisse) held the bag.

**Exercise 2 (Stablecoins):**
Tether/USDC is a Shadow Bank.
Assets: Treasuries/Commercial Paper. Liabilities: Tokens ($1 redemption).
If Tether has a run $\to$ Must sell Treasuries $\to$ Spills over to TradFi.
