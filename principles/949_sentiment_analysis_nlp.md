# Sentiment Analysis NLP Large Language Models

## I. Executive Summary

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** transforms unstructured text (News, Tweets, SEC Filings) into structured **Signal**. The evolution from "Bag of Words" to **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (BERT, GPT) allows capturing **Context**, **Nuance**, and **Sarcasm**. The synthesis argues that Text is now a **Primary Asset Class**, as valuable as Price.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Sentiment Scoring)
Input: "Tesla recalls 1M cars but reports record profits."
Bag of Words: "Recall" (-1), "Record" (+1), "Profits" (+1). Net +1.
Transformer (GPT): Understands "Recall" is distinct from "Profits."
Output: Sentiment Vector [-1, 1].
Used to rebalance portfolios instantly.

### Definition 2.2 (Named Entity Recognition - NER)
Identifying *who* the text is about.
"Apple" (Fruit) vs "Apple" (Stock).
Disambiguation is key.
Mapping text to Ticker Symbols.
Knowledge Graphs link entities ("Supplier of," "CEO of").

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Speed of Information
Old: Human reads WSJ -> Trades. Latency: Minutes.
New: Algo reads press release -> Trades. Latency: Milliseconds.
Language is processed at machine speed.
Price adjusts *before* any human has read the headline.
"Algorithmic Reading."

### 3.2 Hallucination Risk
LLMs can invent facts.
"Microsoft acquiring GM." (Fake news generated by bot).
Algos trade on it.
Flash crash/pump.
Verification layer is needed.
"Truth Consensus" across multiple sources.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Fed Watchers (Fedspeak)
Analyzing FOMC minutes.
Measuring "Hawkishness" vs "Dovishness" using Cosine Similarity against previous minutes.
"The removal of the word 'Patient' implies a rate hike."
Forecasting the Dot Plot.

### 4.2 Earnings Call Q&A
CEO prepares the script (Polished).
Q&A is unscripted (Real).
NLP analyzes Voice Tone (Audio) and stuttering/hesitation.
"Cognitive Dissonance" detection.
If CEO says "Great quarter" but voice trembles $\implies$ Short.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Twitter Sentiment vs Price):**
Crypto markets are 90% sentiment driven.
Correlation between "Bitcoin" tweet volume and Price.
Causality?
Does Price drive Tweets, or Tweets drive Price?
Granger Causality tests suggest bidirectional loop (Reflexivity).

**Exercise 2 (ESG Scoring):**
NLP scans CSR reports.
Detects "Greenwashing."
Compares claims ("We are net zero") with news ("Oil spill").
Automated ESG verification.
