# The Ontology of Money

## I. Executive Summary

What *is* Money? **Commodity Theory** says it's Gold (Intrinsic). **State Theory** (Chartalism) says it's a Tax Credit (Fiat). **Credit Theory** says it's a Ledger of Debts (IOUs). The synthesis argues that Money is a **Social Protocol** for transferring value across time and space. It is "Frozen Trust."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Money Qualities)
Durability (Doesn't rot).
Divisibility (Make change).
Portability (Easy to carry).
Fungibility (1 Unit = 1 Unit).
Scarcity (Hard to counterfeit).
Acceptability (Network Effect).
Gold wins on durability. Crypto wins on portability. Fiat wins on acceptability.

### Definition 2.2 (The Hierarchy of Money)
Perry Mehrling.
Top: Gold (Ultimate settlement? Historic).
Top (Modern): Reserves (Fed liability).
Middle: Bank Deposits (Bank liability).
Bottom: Securities (Private liability).
In a crisis, everyone tries to move up the hierarchy.
"Inside Money" (Credit) collapses into "Outside Money" (Base Money).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Chartalism (Knapp/MMT)
Money is a creature of the State.
State demands taxes in Dollars.
Therefore, people need Dollars.
State spends Dollars into existence first, looking to tax them back later.
Taxes drive demand for money.
Implication: Bitcoin cannot succeed unless it can pay taxes?
Or unless it forms a "Network State."

### 3.2 The Ledger Theory
Money is Memory.
Kocherlakota.
If we had a perfect, public memory of all favors given and received, we wouldn't need money.
Money is a token representing "I did something useful for society."
Blockchain *is* the perfect memory.
Therefore, Blockchain is the ultimate money?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Gresham's Law (Thiers' Law)
Bad money drives out good (Circulation).
Good money drives out bad (Store of Value).
If Inflation is high, spend Fiat (Bad), hoard Gold/BTC (Good).
Dollarization in Emerging Markets: People reject local "Bad" money for "Good" Dollars.

### 4.2 Synthetic Money
Stablecoins.
Private money backed by Public money.
Eurodollars.
Private money backed by... bank promises.
The system is hybrid.
Central Banks manage the Core; Private Banks manage the Periphery.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Rai Stones of Yap):**
Giant stones at bottom of ocean.
Everyone agreed who owned them.
Mental ledger.
Money = Consensus.
Physical token is secondary.

**Exercise 2 (The Death of the Penny):**
Cost to mint > Face value.
Debasement of coinage.
Shift to digital.
Does the "Physicality" of money matter for psychological anchoring?
Cashless society feels "less real" $\implies$ higher spending?
