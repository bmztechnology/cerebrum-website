# The January Effect Tax Loss Swapping

## I. Executive Summary

The **January Effect** is a calendar anomaly where small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks significantly in January. The primary driver is **Tax Loss Selling** in December (investors selling losers to offset gains), which depresses prices. In January, this pressure lifts, and investors buy back the assets, causing a mean-reversion rally.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Turn-of-the-Year Effect)
$R_{Jan} > R_{Feb...Dec}$.
Especially pronounced in Micro-caps ($<\$500M$).
Institutions "Window Dress" in December (selling embarrassing losers so they don't appear in annual reports).
This dump creates the bounce.

### Definition 2.2 (Wash Sale Constraints)
IRS Rule: Cannot buy back for 30 days.
investors sell in late Nov / early Dec.
Buy back in early Jan.
Demand shock + Thin liquidity = Price spike.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Limits to Arbitrage
Why doesn't it disappear?
Transaction costs in micro-caps are high (Bid-ask spread).
Risk of holding small caps is high.
Arbitrageurs cannot fully exploit it due to "Inventory Risk" over the holiday period.

### 3.2 Global Evidence
Australia (Tax year ends June): Effect happens in July.
UK (Tax year ends April): Effect happens in April.
Confirms the Tax Loss Selling hypothesis over the "Seasonal Mood" hypothesis.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Front-Running
Strategy: Buy small-cap losers in mid-December.
Sell them in mid-January.
"Catching the bounce."
Risk: The "Loser" might go bankrupt (Fundamental risk).

### 4.2 The "Santa Claus Rally"
Related but distinct.
Rally in last 5 days of Dec and first 2 of Jan.
Attributed to optimism, holiday bonuses, and low volume.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Size Factor Interaction):**
Small Minus Big (SMB) factor returns are concentrated in January.
If you exclude January, the Size Premium largely disappears in modern data.
Is SMB just a seasonal tax artifact?

**Exercise 2 (Liquidity Premium):**
January effect is huge in illiquid stocks.
Volume dries up in Dec (Sellers hitting bid).
Volume returns in Jan (Buyers lifting offer).
Price change is a function of Liquidity change.
