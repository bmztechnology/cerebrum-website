# Climate Finance and Resilience

## I. Executive Summary

**Climate Change** introduces **Physical Risk** (Hurricanes/Fires) and **Transition Risk** (Carbon Tax/Stranded Assets). **Climate Finance** attempts to price these externalities. The synthesis focuses on **Resilience**: Investing in adaptation (Seawalls, GMO Crops, Water) rather than just mitigation (Solar panels). Market prices are beginning to reflect the "Climate Value at Risk" (CVaR).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stranded Assets)
Oil reserves that cannot be burned if we stay $< 2^\circ C$.
Valued at \$0?
Currently valued at Trillions on balance sheets.
Carbon Bubble.
If regulation tightens, these assets "Strand."
Write-downs implode bank capital.

### Definition 2.2 (Greenium)
Green Premium.
Green Bonds yield slightly less than Brown Bonds.
Investors accept lower return for "impact."
Is it rational?
Yes, if Brown Bonds have higher tail risk (Litigation/Regulation).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Tragedy of the Horizon (Carney)
Climate impact is far future.
CEO mandate is quarterly.
Mismatch.
Markets fail to price long-term risks.
Need Mandatory Disclosure (TCFD) to force pricing.

### 3.2 Double Materiality
1. Outside-In: How Climate hurts the Company (Flood risk).
2. Inside-Out: How Company hurts the Climate (Emissions).
Financially, only #1 matters?
EU Regulation (CSRD) says both matter.
US (SEC) focused on #1.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Catastrophe Bonds (Cat Bonds)
Insurance Linked Securities (ILS).
"If hurricane hits Florida, you lose principal. If not, get 10% coupon."
Uncorrelated with Stock Market.
Diversification.
But risks are rising (Climate change models potentially underestimating frequency).

### 4.2 Water Arbitrage
Michael Burry.
Water is the ultimate scarce resource.
Buy farmland with water rights in aquifers.
"Almond arbitrage" (Exporting virtual water).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Florida Real Estate):**
Insurers leaving Florida.
Mortgages require insurance.
If no insurance $\implies$ no mortgage $\implies$ House prices collapse?
Climate Minsky Moment.

**Exercise 2 (Carbon Offsets):**
VCM (Voluntary Carbon Market).
"Wild West."
Fraud (Phantom forests).
Tokenization trying to fix verification.
Price of Carbon is the most important number in the world economy.
