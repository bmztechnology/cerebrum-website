# Catastrophe Bonds CAT: Uncorrelated Beta

## I. Executive Summary

**Catastrophe Bonds (CAT Bonds)** transfer insurance risk (Hurricanes, Earthquakes, Pandemics) to capital markets. Investors receive a high coupon. If a specific **Trigger Event** (e.g., Category 5 Hurricane hitting Florida) occurs, the Principal is **forgiven** (used to pay insurance claims). They offer **Zero Correlation** to the stock market, making them valuable for portfolio diversification.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trigger)
-   **Indemnity Trigger:** Based on actual losses of the Insurer. (Moral hazard? Transparency issues).
-   **Parametric Trigger:** Based on physical data (Wind speed > 150mph at Location X). Clear, objective, fast settlement.
-   **Industry Loss Index:** PCS Index losses > \$10B.

### Definition 2.2 (Structure)
SPV issues bond. Keeps cash in Treasuries.
Enters Reinsurance Swap with Insurer.
Insurer pays Premium $\to$ Bond Coupon.
If Trigger: SPV gives cash to Insurer. Bond defaults.
If No Trigger: SPV returns cash to Investor.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Modeling Risk (RMS/AIR)
Requires Meteorological / Seismological models.
"Exceedance Probability Curve."
Expected Loss (EL).
Price = EL + Risk Margin.
Multiples (Margin / EL) typically 2x-4x.

### 3.2 Correlation Benefits
Hurricane Andrew doesn't care about the S&P 500.
Beta $\approx$ 0.
Ideal "Alternative Asset."
Pension funds allocate 3-5% to ILS (Insurance Linked Securities) to smooth volatility.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Pandemic Bonds
World Bank issued Pandemic Bonds.
Trigger: Outbreak size/geography.
2020 Covid triggered payout.
Investors lost principal. Funds went to poor nations for aid.
Controversy over "Too late" triggers.

### 4.2 Climate Change Pricing
CAT bonds are the "Market Market for Climate Risk."
Rising trend of premiums for Florida Wind.
Investors demanding higher yields ("Climate Risk Premium").
If models underestimate climate change frequency, investors lose.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Great 2017 Season):**
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria.
Massive losses in CAT bond market.
Some funds down 15%.
Market recovered. Prices hardened (Yields went up).

**Exercise 2 (Correlation in Tail):**
Is it truly uncorrelated?
If "The Big One" hits California (Quake).
GDP drops. Market crashes. CAT bonds default.
Correlation $\to$ 1 in extreme tail?
Maybe.
