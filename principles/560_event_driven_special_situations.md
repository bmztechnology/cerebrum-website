# Event Driven Special Situations

## I. Executive Summary

**Event Driven** strategies seek to capitalize on corporate events that cause pricing inefficiencies. This umbrella covers **Merger Arbitrage**, **Distressed Debt** (Chapter 11), **Spinoffs**, **Recapitalizations**, and **Activism**. The thesis is that corporate events create complexity ("Hair") that forces traditional investors to sell, creating an opportunity for specialists to buy assets below intrinsic value or "Catalyst value."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Spinoff)
Conglomerate separates a division into a new public company.
Parent shareholders receive shares of "NewCo."
Forced Selling: Parent is S&P 500, NewCo is Small Cap. Index funds *must* sell NewCo.
Opportunity: Buy NewCo from forced sellers.

### Definition 2.2 (Activism)
Accumulate stake (>5%).
File 13D.
Agitate for change (Buybacks, Sale of Company, New CEO).
Create your own catalyst.
"Operational Activism" vs "Financial Engineering."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Soft Catalyst vs Hard Catalyst
Hard: Merger agreement signed. Definitive date. (Low risk, low return).
Soft: "Strategic Review" announced. Rumors. (High risk, high return).
Event Driven managers play the spectrum.

### 3.2 Complexity Premium
The harder a deal is to analyze, the less efficient the pricing.
Rights Offerings.
Contingent Value Rights (CVRs).
Litigation outcomes.
The alpha is in reading the 400-page prospectus.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Post-Reorg Equities
Company emerges from Bankruptcy.
Old debt converted to new equity.
Former bondholders (Banks) don't want equity. They sell.
Stock trades at 3x P/E.
Event Driven funds buy the flush.

### 4.2 Capital Structure Arbitrage
Long Senior Debt / Short Junior Debt.
Betting on recovery rates narrowing.
Or betting that the company is *worth* the Enterprise Value, but the equity is a zero.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Stub Trade):**
Long Parent / Short Subsidiary (after partial IPO).
Implied value of Parent's core business might be negative.
See: 3Com / Palm Pilot case.

**Exercise 2 (Dutch Tender):**
Company buys back stock via auction.
Odd-lot provision.
Small account arbitrage opportunities.
