# Agri Commodities Seasonality and Weather

## I. Executive Summary

**Agricultural Commodities** (Corn, Soybeans, Wheat) are biological assets driven by the **Planting/Harvest Cycle**. Unlike metals (continuous production), Ags have **discrete supply shocks** (Harvest). Microstructure is defined by **Seasonality**, **Weather Sensitivity** (El Niño), and the **WASDE Report** (USDA data). The **basis** reflects local storage and transportation logistics (Barge/Rail).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Crop Year)
Planting (Spring) $\to$ Pollination (Summer/Critical) $\to$ Harvest (Fall).
**Old Crop:** Inventory from last harvest (Spot/Near Futures).
**New Crop:** Expected harvest (Deferred Futures, e.g., Dec Corn).
**Old/New Spread:** Measures scarcity of current stocks vs expected abundance.
Inverse (Backwardation) represents "Empty Silos."

### Definition 2.2 (Stock-to-Use Ratio)
$$ S/U = \frac{Ending Stocks}{Total Consumption} $$
Critical metric.
Corn: 10% is tight. 15% is abundant.
Volatility explodes as S/U $\to$ 0.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Cobweb Theorem
Price High this year $\implies$ Farmers plant MORE next year $\implies$ Supply Glut $\implies$ Price Low.
Price Low $\implies$ Farmers plant LESS $\implies$ Shortage $\implies$ Price High.
Endogenous volatility cycle.
Damped or Exploding cobweb depending on elasticity.

### 3.2 Weather Microstructure
Rain in July (Corn Belt) = Bearish (Yield $\uparrow$).
Heat in August = Bullish.
Satellite data (NDVI) estimates yield before USDA.
HFTs trade weather models (GFS/ECMWF) forecast updates.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Crush Spread
Soybeans $\to$ Meal + Oil.
Processor margin.
Buy Soybeans / Sell Meal + Oil.
If Crush is high, Processors run full capacity $\implies$ Bean demand $\uparrow$.

### 4.2 Ethanol Mandate
40% of US Corn goes to Ethanol (RFS Mandate).
Links Corn price to Oil price.
If Oil $\uparrow$, Ethanol competitive, Corn Floor rises.
Government policy as a Demand driver.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Russian Wheat Ban):**
2010 Drought.
Russia bans exports.
Global Wheat spikes 50%.
Arab Spring triggered by bread prices.
Food Security risk > Market Rules.

**Exercise 2 (Basis Trading):**
Farmer sells grain to elevator at "Spot - Basis."
Elevator hedges Short Futures.
Elevator profits if Basis "Narrows" (Spot rises relative to Future).
Storage is a Basis trade.
