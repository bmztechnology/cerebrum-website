# Gold Standard History: The Golden Fetters

## I. Executive Summary

The **Gold Standard** (1871-1914, 1925-1931) fixed national currencies to a specific weight of gold. It created a self-regulating global system via the **Price-Specie Flow Mechanism**. However, it removed Monetary Sovereignty, forcing nations to import deflation during crises. Its rigidity is widely cited as the primary cause of the depth of the Great Depression.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Mint Parity)
$1 USD = 23.22$ grains of gold.
$1 GBP = 113$ grains of gold.
Implied Exchange Rate: $4.86 USD/GBP.
Arbitrage kept the rate fixed (Shipping gold across Atlantic if deviation > shipping cost).

### Definition 2.2 (Price-Specie Flow Mechanism - Hume)
Country A has Trade Surplus.
Gold flows into A.
Money Supply A rises $\to$ Prices A rise (Inflation).
Exports A become expensive.
Trade Surplus vanishes.
Automatic balance. No Central Bank needed?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Deflationary Bias
To gain reserves (Gold), you must run a surplus (Compress wages, deflate prices).
System forces adjustment on the Debtor (Deflation) rather than the Creditor (Inflation).
Global bias towards deflation.

### 3.2 The Rules of the Game
Central Banks were supposed to reinforce flow (Raise rates when losing gold).
In 1920s, France and US sterilized inflows (Hoarded gold without inflating).
UK surrendered outflows (Deflated).
System broke because Creditors cheated.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Modern Gold Standard (Bitcoin?)
Bitcoin is a digital Gold Standard (Fixed Supply).
If adopted globally:
No Monetary Policy.
Deflationary Spirals (if economy grows, prices must fall).
High Volatility in real economy, Zero Volatility in money supply.

### 4.2 Gold as the "Anti-Fiat"
Gold price tracks Global Liquidity M2.
It is the inverse of Central Bank confidence.
Trading: Gold is not a commodity; it is a currency with 0% yield and no liability.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (1931):**
UK leaves Gold Standard.
Pound devalues. UK economy recovers early.
France stays on Gold until 1936. Economy suffers depression for 5 more years.
"Golden Fetters" (Eichengreen).

**Exercise 2 (Nixon Shock 1971):**
Ended Bretton Woods (Gold Exchange Standard).
Transition to pure Fiat.
Enabled infinite debt expansion.
Enabled flexible response to shocks.
