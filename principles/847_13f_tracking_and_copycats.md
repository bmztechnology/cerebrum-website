# 13F Tracking and Copycat Strategies

## I. Executive Summary

**13F Filings** are quarterly reports filed by Institutional Managers (> \$100M AUM) disclosing their US Long Equity holdings. **Copycat Strategies** attempt to replicate the returns of top Hedge Funds (e.g., Tiger Global, Berkshire) by cloning these portfolios. Microstructure challenges include the **45-day Lag**, **Hidden Shorts**, and **Window Dressing**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The 45-Day Lag)
Q1 ends March 31.
Filing due May 15.
Data is usually 45 days old.
HFT/Momentum funds have already entered and exited.
Value funds (Buffett) hold for years $\implies$ Lag matters less.

### Definition 2.2 (Selection Bias)
Which funds to clone?
"Tiger Cubs" (Julian Robertson lineage).
Pershing Square (Ackman).
If you clone *all* Hedge Funds, you get the Market (minus fees).
Alpha is in the "Best Ideas" of the best managers.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Consensus Trades
"Hedge Fund Hotels."
Stocks owned by 50+ top funds (e.g., Microsoft, Visa).
High Crowding.
Risk: Liquidity cascade if they all rush for the exit (Meta 2022).
Copycats often buy the top of the crowded trade.

### 3.2 What is Missing?
13F does not show:
1. Short Positions.
2. Derivatives (Swaps / OTC Options).
3. International Holdings.
4. Cash.
Copying a L/S fund based only on Longs is dangerous (They might be Net Short via Swaps).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Activist Pop
Activist (Icahn) files 13D (5% stake, Intent to change control).
Stock pops 5-10% immediately.
Immediate disclosure required (10 days).
Copycats buy on the 13D filing to ride the activist campaign.

### 4.2 Window Dressing
Manager sells losing stocks on March 30 to hide them from the report.
Buys "Winners" to show them off.
Distorts the 13F signal.
"Portfolio Hygiene."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Cloning ETF):**
GURU, ALPH.
ETFs that mechanically track 13Fs.
Performance?
Mixed. Lag + Fees erode the Alpha.
Direct cloning (DIY) saves the fees.

**Exercise 2 (Buffett's Secret):**
Buffett requested SEC confidential treatment for building a stake (e.g., Chevron).
Hidden from 13F for a quarter.
Revealed later.
Prevents front-running.
