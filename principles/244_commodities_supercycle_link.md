# Commodity Supercycle Link: Terms of Trade

## I. Executive Summary

Emerging Markets are historically levered to the **Commodity Cycle**. A "Supercycle" is a decades-long trend of rising commodity prices driven by structural supply shortages and urbanization demand. For commodity exporters (LatAm, Middle East, Africa), a supercycle improves **Terms of Trade**, strengthens currencies, and funds social programs. For importers (India, Turkey), it creates an inflation crisis.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Terms of Trade - ToT)
$$ToT = \frac{\text{Price of Exports}}{\text{Price of Imports}}$$
If ToT rises (e.g., Oil price up for Saudi), the country gets richer without producing more volume.
Income Effect.

### Definition 2.2 (The Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis)
Argues that ToT for commodities declines over the long run vs manufactured goods.
Therefore, EMs should industrialize.
*Counter-argument:* During Supercycles (2000-2011, 2020-?), Commodities outperform Tech.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The FX Beta
Regressing Currencies against Commodities.
$AUD \approx 0.8 \times Copper + 0.2 \times Risk$.
$CAD \approx Oil$.
$ZAR \approx Platinum/Gold$.
$CLP \approx Lithium/Copper$.
To trade these currencies, you must trade the underlying commodity.

### 3.2 Capital Expenditure (Capex) Cycle
Commodity prices crash $\to$ Capex Stops $\to$ Supply Shortage 5 years later $\to$ Prices Spike $\to$ Capex Starts $\to$ Oversupply.
We are currently in the "Supply Shortage" phase (due to ESG underinvestment 2012-2020).
Bullish EMs.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long LatAm / Short Asia
In a Commodity Bull Market:
LatAm (Sellers of stuff) outperform.
Asia (Buyers of stuff) underperform.
Pairs Trade: Long BRL / Short INR.

### 4.2 Fiscal Impulses
Windfall revenues lead to populist spending.
Saudi "Vision 2030."
Brazil "Bolsa Familia."
When prices drop, spending remains $\to$ Deficits explode $\to$ Crisis.
"The Ant and the Grasshopper."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Dutch Disease Validation):**
Australia during Mining Boom.
AUD parity with USD.
Car manufacturing in Australia died (too expensive).
Economy became a "Mine with a Housing Bubble attached."

**Exercise 2 (Lithium Triangle):**
Chile, Argentina, Bolivia.
New "Saudi Arabia of Lithium."
Nationalization risk (Strategic Autonomy).
Prices might be high, but will foreign investors capture the value?
