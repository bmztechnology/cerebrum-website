# Friendshoring Networks: The Trust Premium

## I. Executive Summary

**Friendshoring** (or Ally-shoring) is the reorganization of supply chains to politically aligned nations. It prioritizes **Resilience** over **Efficiency**. This marks the end of "Just-in-Time" globalization and the rise of "Just-in-Case" regionalism. The "China Plus One" strategy benefits countries like Vietnam, Mexico, and India.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Efficiency-Security Trade-off)
Globalism minimized Cost ($C$).
Friendshoring minimizes Risk ($R$).
New Cost Function: $Min(C + \lambda R)$.
Where $\lambda$ is the "Fear Factor" (War, Sanctions, Pandemic).
Result: Higher Prices (Inflation) but lower Volatility of supply.

### Definition 2.2 (Rules of Origin Weaponization)
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in US.
EV Tax Credits only if minerals mined in Free Trade partner.
Forces supply chain out of China.
Explicit industrial policy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Network Theory - Centrality
China was the "Central Node" of global manufacturing.
Removing a central node is expensive.
Re-wiring takes decades.
"Stickiness" of clusters (Shenzhen has all component suppliers in 1 hour radius).
Vietnam cannot replicate this ecosystem overnight.

### 3.2 The "Anywhere But China" (ABC) Strategy
Corporate Boards mandate ABC.
Not political, but fiduciary.
Risk of Taiwan invasion makes China uninvestable for manufacturing.
FDI flows to China turned Negative in 2023.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Mexican Moment
USMCA + Proximity.
Tesla Gigafactory Mexico.
Chinese companies moving to Mexico to become "Mexican".
Long Mexican Pesos / Industrial REITs.

### 4.2 The Losers
Germany.
Built model on cheap Russian gas and Chinese exports.
Friendshoring cuts both.
De-industrialization of the Rhine model.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Rare Earths):**
China controls 90% of processing.
Friendshoring requires building processing in US/Australia.
Polluting, expensive.
NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard) blocks it.
Friendshoring hits the "Green Wall."

**Exercise 2 (Inflation):**
Barclays estimates Friendshoring adds 1% to structural inflation.
We pay a "Trust Premium."
Central Banks must accept higher inflation target?
