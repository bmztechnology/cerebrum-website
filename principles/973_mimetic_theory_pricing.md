# Mimetic Theory and Pricing Girard

## I. Executive Summary

**René Girard's Mimetic Theory** states that human desire is not autonomous; it is **Imitated**. We desire things because *others* desire them (The Model). In Finance, this explains **Bubbles**, **Fads**, and **Volatility**. Price is not a reflection of fundamental utility, but an **Index of Mimetic Intensity**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Triangular Desire)
Subject (Trader) -> Model (Influencer) -> Object (Stock).
Trader A respects Trader B.
Trader B buys Tesla.
Trader A buys Tesla *to be like B*.
The utility of the stock is secondary to the relationship with the Model.

### Definition 2.2 (Mimetic Crisis)
When everyone desires the same finite object.
Conflict.
Rivalry.
"The Scapegoat Mechanism."
Market Crash = Exploring the violence of rivalry?
Or finding a Scapegoat (Bear Stearns / SBF) to blame for the excess?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Thiel’s Contrarianism
Peter Thiel (Student of Girard).
"Competition is for Losers."
Competition is Mimesis (Copying).
True Value comes from doing what no one else is doing (0 to 1).
Investing in Monopolies (Unique) vs Commodities (Mimetic).
Bitcoin as a Mimetic Schelling Point (Thiel invested early).

### 3.2 Momentum as Mimesis
Trend Following.
"Buy what is going up."
Pure mimesis.
Crowd validation.
The algorithm is a "Mimetic Machine."
Accelerating the feedback loop.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Luxury Paradox
Veblen Goods are Mimetic Goods.
Birkin Bag.
You want it because it's hard to get and others want it.
LVMH manages "Mimetic Tension" (Artificial Scarcity).
Investing in Mimetic Managers.

### 4.2 Identifying the Model
Who is the market copying?
1990s: Soros.
2010s: Buffett.
2020: Cathie Wood / Elon Musk.
When the "Model" fails (Cathie Wood -70%), the Mimesis collapses violently.
"Kill the Idol."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (FOMO):**
Fear Of Missing Out.
Biological expression of Mimesis.
"The tribe is eating, I am starving."
To fight FOMO is to fight biology.
Algo trading removes the biological impulse.

**Exercise 2 (The Contrarian Trap):**
Trying to be Contrarian is also mimetic (Negative Mimesis).
"I will do the opposite of the crowd."
You are still defined by the crowd.
True independence is "Orthogonal." (Doing something unrelated).
