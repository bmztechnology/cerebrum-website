# Money Creation: The Mechanics of Fiat

## I. Executive Summary

**Money Creation** is often misunderstood as "printing paper." In modern economies, 97% of money is created by private commercial banks when they issue loans, not by the Central Bank. The Central Bank controls the *price* of reserves (Interest Rate) and sometimes the *quantity* (QE), but the actual expansion of the Money Supply (M2) depends on the "Fractional Reserve Banking" system and the demand for credit.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Money Multiplier)
$$m = \frac{1}{R}$$
-   $R$: Reserve Requirement Ratio (e.g., 10%).
-   Max Money Supply $M = B \times m$, where $B$ is the Monetary Base (Reserves).
*Note: In post-2008 regimes, $R$ is often effectively zero. Capital Requirements (Basel III) constrain lending, not Reserve Requirements.*

### Definition 2.2 (The Hierarchy of Money)
-   **M0 (Base Money):** Physical Cash + Bank Reserves at the Fed.
-   **M1:** M0 + Demand Deposits (Checking accounts).
-   **M2:** M1 + Savings Accounts + Retail Money Market Funds.
-   **M3:** M2 + Large Time Deposits + Institutional Money Markets. (Total Liquidity).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Endogenous Money Theory
Banks do not wait for deposits to lend.
They lend first, creating a deposit (Liability) and a Loan (Asset) simultaneously.
"Loans create Deposits."
Reserves are sought *after* the fact to settle interbank payments.
The Central Bank accommodates this demand to target the interest rate.

### 3.2 The Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)
When Rates = 0%, the traditional transmission mechanism breaks.
Cash becomes an attractive asset (Real return > Bond measure).
Central Bank must switch to Unconventional Policy (QE).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Liquidity Traps
If Private Sector is deleveraging (paying down debt), Money Supply shrinks even if Rates are 0%.
Scenario: Japan 1990s, US 2008.
Trading Strategy: Short Banking Stocks, Long Bonds. Avoid Inflation Hedges (Gold) because Deflation is the risk.

### 4.2 Watching M2 Growth
M2 Growth > GDP Growth = Inflationary Pressure (Long term).
M2 Growth Negative = Deflationary Shock (2022-2023 phenomenon).
Algo Signal: "If M2 YoY < 0%, Short Commodities."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Balance Sheet):**
Bank A lends $100 to Customer.
Asset: Loan +100.
Liability: Deposit +100.
Did the Fed print anything? No.
Did Money Supply increase? Yes ($100 new purchasing power).

**Exercise 2 (Velocity):**
Equation of Exchange: $MV = PQ$.
If $M$ triples (QE) but $V$ (Velocity) collapses by 66%.
Inflation ($P$) stays flat.
This explains why QE didn't cause Hyperinflation in 2010-2020. Velocity crashed.
