# Time Preference and Civilization

## I. Executive Summary

**Time Preference** is the ratio of valuing the Present vs the Future. **Low Time Preference** (Patience) builds civilization (Planting trees, saving, investing). **High Time Preference** (Impatience) consumes capital (Eating seeds, debt). The synthesis links **Interest Rates** to the "Civilizational Discount Rate." Artificially low rates (ZIRP) paradoxically increase Time Preference by destroying the incentive to save.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Discount Rate $r$)
Value today = Value tomorrow / $(1+r)$.
If $r$ is high: Future is worthless. Eat, drink, and be merry. (Nihilism).
If $r$ is low: Future is valuable. Build cathedrals. (Civilization).
The Marshmallow Test.
Society-wide Marshmallow Test.

### Definition 2.2 (Decivilization)
Hoppe.
Democracy encourages High Time Preference? (Politician only cares about next 4 years).
Monarchy encouraged Low Time Preference? (King cares about dynasty 100 years out).
Debatable political theory, but financial application is sound:
Short-termism (Quarterly Capitalism) eats the seed corn.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Austrian Theory of Interest
Interest is not the "Price of Money."
It is the "Price of Time."
Manipulating it distorts the coordinate system of time.
ZIRP signals: "Resources are infinite, take 100 years to pay back."
Reality: Resources are scarce.
Malinvestment: Building bridges to nowhere because capital cost 0%.

### 3.2 Inflation and Time Preference
Inflation steals purchasing power from the future.
Rational response: Spend now.
High Time Preference is an adaptation to bad money.
Deflation (Bitcoin) rewards saving.
Rational response: Save for future.
Low Time Preference "renormalization"?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Duration Risk
Long Duration Asset (Tech stock / 30Y Bond).
Value is far in future.
Requires Low Time Preference investors.
If society becomes impatient (Inflation/War), Long Duration crashes.
Short Duration (Commodities/Cash) outperforms.

### 4.2 Corporate Short-Termism
Share Buybacks vs R&D.
Buyback hits EPS *now*. R&D hits EPS *in 10 years*.
CEO tenure is 5 years.
Incentive: Buybacks.
Hollowing out the industrial base.
Intel vs TSMC.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Cathedral Builder):**
Builders started cathedrals knowing they wouldn't see completion.
Infinite horizon.
How to fund this today?
Century Bonds? (Austria issued 100Y bond).
Or just pure faith?

**Exercise 2 (The 401k Trap):**
Forcing people to have Low Time Preference (Lock up money for 40 years).
Tax incentive.
Government engineering patience.
