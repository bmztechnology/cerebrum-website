# Geopolitics as an Asset Class

## I. Executive Summary

**Geopolitical Risk** is no longer an exogenous shock; it is a structural driver of returns. The transition from **Globalization** (Efficiency) to **Multipolarity** (Security) reprices assets. Concepts include **Friend-shoring**, **Weaponized Interdependence** (Sanctions), and the **fragmentation** of payment systems. Investors now model "Geopolitical Alpha."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Peace Dividend)
1990-2020.
Defense spending $\downarrow$. Global Supply Chains $\uparrow$. Inflation $\downarrow$.
Result: PE multiples expanded. Margins hit record highs.
Reversal: "War Dividend" (or Tax).
Defense $\uparrow$. Reshoring (Costly). Inflation $\uparrow$.
Margins compress.

### Definition 2.2 (Weaponized Interdependence)
Network Theory.
Nodes (SWIFT, Dollar Clearing) are bottlenecks.
US controls the nodes. Use them to sanction Russia.
Result: Russia/China build alternative nodes (CIPS, SPFS).
Fragmentation of the global financial network.
Risk of "Stranded Assets" due to sanctions (e.g., Russian ADRs).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Thucydides Trap
Rising Power (China) threatens Ruling Power (USA).
Historical probability of war: 75%.
Investment implication:
Decoupling of tech stacks (Semiconductors).
"Invest in places that can bomb the places you don't invest in?" (Grim realism).

### 3.2 Resource Nationalism
Lithium, Copper, Rare Earths.
Strategic minerals.
Countries (Chile, Mexico) nationalizing resources.
Export bans (Indonesia Nickel).
Commodity markets dictated by State Security, not Free Market.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Defense Tech
VC pouring money into Anduril/Palantir.
"Dual Use" technology.
Silicon Valley aligning with Pentagon.
ESG dilemma: Is Defense "Socially" Good (protecting democracy) or Bad (weapons)?
EU Taxonomy labeled Defense as "Sustainable."

### 4.2 Gold as Geopolitical Hedge
Central Banks buying Gold (China, Poland).
Why?
Gold cannot be sanctioned/frozen (if held physically).
"Outside Money."
De-dollarization hedge.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (TSMC Tail Risk):**
Taiwan Semiconductor.
Manufactures 90% of advanced chips.
China invasion risk.
Priced into the stock? (PE ratio low vs Nvidia).
Geopolitical discount.

**Exercise 2 (The Ruble Rebound):**
2022 Sanctions. Ruble crashed.
Capital Controls + Energy Exports (in Rubles).
Ruble recovered.
Demonstrates limits of financial warfare against commodity superpowers.
