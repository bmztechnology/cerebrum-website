# Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs): The State Capitalists

## I. Executive Summary

**Sovereign Wealth Funds** are state-owned investment vehicles that manage a country's surplus reserves. Giants like **NBIM (Norway)**, **CIC (China)**, **ADIA (Abu Dhabi)**, and **PIF (Saudi Arabia)** control trillions of dollars. They are the "Whales" of global markets, capable of moving asset prices and executing strategic state goals (Soft Power) through capital allocation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Sources of Funds)
-   **Commodity Funds:** Funded by Oil/Gas exports (Norway, Saudi, Kuwait). Goal: Intergenerational savings (Post-oil future).
-   **Non-Commodity Funds:** Funded by Trade Surpluses / Forex Reserves (China, Singapore GIC). Goal: Diversification and Yield.

### Definition 2.2 (The Governance Models)
-   **Passive (Norway):** Owns 1.5% of every listed company. Strict ESG rules. Transparent.
-   **Active/Strategic (Saudi PIF):** Buys Tesla, Uber, Golf Leagues, Newcastle United. Tools of foreign policy and economic diversification (Vision 2030).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The SWF Put
In 2008, SWFs bailed out Western Banks (Citi, UBS).
"Capital of Last Resort."
They invest counter-cyclically.
When markets crash, SWFs rebalance (Buy Stocks).

### 3.2 State Capitalism
Blurring lines between Private and Public.
If State Funds own the tech sector, is it free market?
CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the US) blocks SWFs from buying "Sensitive Tech" (Defense, Chips).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Flow Watching
Norway publishes holdings.
Changes imply sector rotation.
Saudi PIF flows imply "The Next Big Thing" (e.g., Gaming, EV, AI).
Following the Sovereign Money.

### 4.2 The "Petrodollar Recycling" Mechanism
Oil Price High $\to$ Saudi/Norway Revenue High $\to$ SWF Buys US Treasuries/Stocks.
Liquidity flows back to the West.
If SWFs stop buying US assets (and buy domestic infrastructure instead), Global Liquidity tightens.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Temasek - Singapore):**
Invested in FTX (Crypto exchange). Lost $275M.
Even Sovereigns get rugged.
Due diligence failure.
Reputational damage > Financial damage.

**Exercise 2 (Norway's Ethics):**
Ban on Coal, Tobacco, Nuclear weapons.
When Norway sells, the stock price drops (Signaling effect).
The "Anti-ESG" portfolio strategy: Buy what Norway is forced to sell (Value capture).
