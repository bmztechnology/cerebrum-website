# Bubbles in the Lab Replication

## I. Executive Summary

Replication studies of the SSW experiments reveal the **Robustness** of bubbles. Factors that **inflate** bubbles include: High Cash Endowments (Liquidity), Margin Buying, and "Excitement" (Hype). Factors that **deflate** bubbles include: Short Selling, Futures Markets (Hedging), and Experience. The lab serves as a wind tunnel for testing market regulations.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cash-to-Asset Ratio)
High ratio $\implies$ More money chasing same assets $\implies$ Larger Bubble.
Central Bank analogy: QE (Quantitative Easing) injects cash $\implies$ Asset Inflation.
Lab proves the monetary link to bubbles.

### Definition 2.2 (The Crash Dynamics)
Crashes in the lab are faster than booms.
Asymmetry.
"Up by the stairs, down by the elevator."
Trigger: Usually when Price > $2 \times FV$.
Momentum breaks, everyone rushes for the exit (Crowded Trade).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Heterogeneous Beliefs
Some agents are fundamentalists (Trade FV).
Some are chartists (Trade Trend).
Bubble assumes Chartists dominate Fundamentalists.
Crash happens when Fundamentalists (or reality) re-assert control.

### 3.2 Learning
Subjects who played once don't bubble the second time.
"Once bitten, twice shy."
Markets only bubble because of "New Money" (Uninformed entrants).
An "Experienced Only" market is efficient.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Regulatory Design
Should we ban margin?
Lab says: Margin increases bubble amplitude.
Restricting leverage is scientifically proven to dampen volatility.
Crypto (100x leverage) validates the lab results.

### 4.2 Circuit Breakers
Does halting trading help?
Lab results mixed.
Sometimes halts allow panic to subside.
Sometimes halts create "Magnet Effect" (Panic selling *before* the halt).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The "Soft Landing"):**
Can a bubble deflate slowly?
Rarely.
Expectations are fragile.
Once the "Growth Story" is broken, the feedback loop reverses.

**Exercise 2 (Information Transparency):**
Showing a "Fair Value" line on the chart.
Does it stop the bubble?
Surprisingly, No.
People ignore the line and trade the price.
"Price is the news."
