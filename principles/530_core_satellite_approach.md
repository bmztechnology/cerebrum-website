# Core Satellite Approach: Beta and Alpha

## I. Executive Summary

**Core-Satellite** divides the portfolio into two distinct components. The **Core** ($70-90\%$) consists of low-cost, passive, broad-market index funds (Beta) to capture the asset class return. The **Satellite** ($10-30\%$) consists of high-conviction, active strategies (Alpha) like Hedge Funds, Stock Picking, or Sector bets. This structure minimizes fees while preserving the potential for outperformance.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Fee Arbitrage)
Old Model: 100% Active Mutual Funds. Expense Ratio 1.0%.
Core-Satellite:
-   80% ETF (0.05%).
-   20% Hedge Fund (2.0% + 20%).
-   Weighted Fee: $0.04\% + 0.4\% = 0.44\%$.
Lower cost, higher potential Alpha (Hedge Funds have higher active share than Mutual Funds).

### Definition 2.2 (Risk Budgeting)
Core consumes no "Active Risk Budget" (Tracking Error $\approx$ 0).
Spend entire Risk Budget in the Satellites.
Concentrated bets allowed in Satellite because Core provides diversification.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Markets Efficiency Hypothesis
Core assumes Developed Markets (US Large Cap) are efficient. (Alpha hard to find).
Satellite assumes Specific Markets (Emerging, Small Cap, Alts) are inefficient. (Alpha exists).
Allocate Active risk where the inefficiency is.

### 3.2 Separation of Alpha/Beta
Portable Alpha.
Satellite: Market Neutral Long/Short. (Pure Alpha).
Core: Futures/ETFs. (Pure Beta).
Sum = Beta + Alpha.
Avoids paying active fees for "Closet Index" mutual funds.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Thematic Satellites
Core: MSCI World.
Satellite: Robotics, Clean Energy, Genomics.
Expresses investor view without disrupting the strategic baseline.

### 4.2 Wealth Management
Client wants to play the market.
Admin: "Okay, you have a 'Play Account' (Satellite) limited to 5% of AUM. Go wild. The rest (95%) stays in the boring Core."
Behavioral finance containment.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Correlation):**
Satellite should ideally be uncorrelated to Core.
If Satellite is "High Beta Tech," it just amplifies Core risk.
If Satellite is "Managed Futures," it offers diversification.

**Exercise 2 (Rebalancing):**
Satellite performs well (doubles).
Becomes too large a % of portfolio.
Sell Satellite, buy Core.
Discipline required.
