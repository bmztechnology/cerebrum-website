# Capital Controls: The Roach Motel

## I. Executive Summary

**Capital Controls** are measures taken by a government to limit the flow of foreign capital in and out of the domestic economy. "You can check in, but you can't check out." Used in crises to prevent Capital Flight and Currency Collapse. Paradoxically, the imposition of capital controls usually signals that the situation is terminal, accelerating the flight via black markets.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Types)
-   **Inflow Controls:** Tax on foreign investment (Brazil IOF). Purpose: Prevent currency overheating/appreciated.
-   **Outflow Controls:** Limits on withdrawals/transfers (Argentina, Iceland, Greece). Purpose: Prevent collapse.

### Definition 2.2 (Exchange Rate Unification)
When controls exist, parallel rates emerge.
-   **Official Rate:** 100 Pesos = 1 USD. (For connection friends).
-   **Blue/Black Rate:** 200 Pesos = 1 USD. (Real market).
-   **Gap:** The "Spread" measures the distortion/distress.
Removing controls ("Unification") usually means Official Rate crashes to match Black Rate.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Impossible Trinity (Again)
If you want Fixed Rate + Independent Policy $\implies$ You MUST have Capital Controls.
China Model: Managed Peg + Independent Rates + Closed Capital Account.
It works, but limits the currency's global usage.

### 3.2 Evasion Innovation
Crypto (USDT/Bitcoin) is the #1 tool for evading capital controls today.
Invoice Mispricing (Import a $1 pen, invoice it at $100, send $100 abroad, keep $99 offshore).
Hawala networks.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Carry Trade Trap
High Rates in Turkey/Nigeria attract Carry Traders.
But can you get the money out?
"Repatration Risk."
If Controls hit, your 20% yield is trapped.
Never trade Carry in a country with falling reserves.

### 4.2 The Iceland Case (2008)
Iceland imposed draconian controls.
Trapped foreign investors for 10 years.
Allowed society to stabilize without capital flight.
IMF eventually blessed this "Heterodox" approach.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Argentina Blue Dollar):**
"Dolar Blue."
Arbitrage: Buy Official (if allowed), Sell Blue.
Govt tries to stop it.
"Dolar MEP", "Dolar CCL". 15 different exchange rates.
Sign of a broken monetary system.

**Exercise 2 (China - Recent):**
Crackdown on Macau Junkets.
Why? Junkets were used to move capital out of mainland.
Capital Flight $\approx$ $1 Trillion/year.
