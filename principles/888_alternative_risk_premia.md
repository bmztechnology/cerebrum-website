# The Alternative Risk Premia Synthesis

## I. Executive Summary

**Alternative Risk Premia (ARP)** are the systematic drivers of return in non-traditional assets. Unlike the **Equity Risk Premium** (Beta), ARPs include **Illiquidity Premium**, **Complexity Premium**, **Carry**, and **Momentum** applied to exotic asset classes. The synthesis reveals that "Alpha" is often just "Exotic Beta" disguised by high fees.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Decomposition of Returns)
$$ R_{Alt} = R_f + \beta_{Eq} (ERP) + \beta_{Illiq} (IP) + \beta_{Vol} (VRP) + \alpha_{Pure} $$
Hedge Funds often charge 2/20 for Returns that are explainable by selling Volatility ($\beta_{Vol}$) or locking up capital ($\beta_{Illiq}$).
True Alpha is the residual term $\alpha_{Pure}$ (Skill).
In efficient markets, $\alpha_{Pure} \to 0$.

### Definition 2.2 (The Complexity Premium)
Why do Cat Bonds yield 8%?
Partially risk. Partially because they are *hard to understand*.
Investors demand payment for the cognitive load and legal due diligence required.
As the asset class standardizes (becomes "Vanilla"), the Complexity Premium evaporates.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Skewness Preference
Investors love positive skew (Lottery tickets: VC, Crypto). They overpay for it (Negative expected return).
Investors hate negative skew (Tail risk: Selling Puts, Carry Trade). They demand high returns.
Selling Skew (being Short Gamma) is the fundamental source of Alternative Yield.
"Eating like a bird, pooping like an elephant."

### 3.2 Capacity Constraints
Scalability of ARP.
Trend Following (Liquid Futures) scales to \$300B.
Distressed Debt (Bonds) scales to \$50B.
Litigation Finance (Lawsuits) scales to \$5B.
Returns degrade as Capital $\uparrow$.
The "Indigestible" nature of true Alts preserves the premium.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Cheap vs Rich Alternatives
Private Credit spread = 600bps. Liquid Credit spread = 400bps.
Illiquidity Premium = 200bps.
Is 200bps enough for a 5-year lockup?
Assessment requires modeling the "Shadow Cost of Liquidity" (Option value of cash).

### 4.2 Portable Alpha
Invest 100% in S&P 500 Futures (Beta).
Invest Cash collateral in Market Neutral Alts (Alpha).
Stacking the returns.
Risk: If Alts crash (Correlation = 1 in crisis), you get a Margin Call on the Futures and have no liquidity.
Leverage on leverage.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Endowment Model):**
Yale Model (Swensen).
Result: 30% allocation to Private Equity/Hedge Funds.
Logic: University lives forever. Can harvest Illiquidity Premium better than anyone.
Flaw: In 2008, Yale couldn't pay salaries without borrowing. Liquidity matters even for immortals.

**Exercise 2 (Fee Drag):**
Gross Return 10%.
Fee 2/20.
Net Return 6.4%.
Risk Free Rate 4%.
Sharpe Ratio compression.
The manager captures most of the Alpha.
