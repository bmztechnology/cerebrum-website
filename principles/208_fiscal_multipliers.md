# Fiscal Multipliers: The Keynesian Lever

## I. Executive Summary

The **Fiscal Multiplier** measures the impact of government spending on GDP. If the government spends $1 Billion and GDP grows by $1.5 Billion, the multiplier is 1.5. The magnitude of this multiplier is fiercely debated (Keynesians say > 1, Classical say < 1). It varies dramatically depending on the economic state (Recession vs Boom) and the type of spending (Infrastructure vs Tax Cuts).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Formula)
$$k = \frac{1}{1 - MPC(1-t) + m}$$
-   $MPC$: Marginal Propensity to Consume (How much of 1 extra dollar is spent).
-   $t$: Tax Rate.
-   $m$: Import propensity.
High MPC $\implies$ High Multiplier. (Giving money to poor people has higher multiplier than giving to rich).

### Definition 2.2 (Crowding Out)
If Government borrows to spend $\to$ Interest Rates rise $\to$ Private Investment falls.
This *reduces* the multiplier.
In a Liquidity Trap (Rates fixed at 0%), Crowding Out is zero. Multipliers are maximized (> 2.0).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Spending vs Tax Cuts
-   **Direct Spending (G):** Goes straight into GDP. High Multiplier.
-   **Tax Cuts (T):** Depends on MPC. If people save the tax cut (Ricardian Equivalence), Multiplier is 0.
Empirically: Infrastructure Multiplier $\approx 1.5$. Corporate Tax Cut Multiplier $\approx 0.3$.

### 3.2 The Zero Lower Bound
At ZLB, Fiscal Policy is the *only* tool left.
Monetary Policy is pushing on a string.
Fiscal Policy injects demand directly.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Macro Trading Strategy
If Gov announces Infrastructure Bill $\implies$ Buy Commodities, Buy Construction Stocks.
If Gov announces Tax Cuts $\implies$ Buy Luxury Goods (Wealth Effect).
Watch the "Fiscal Impulse" metric (Change in Deficit/GDP).

### 4.2 Inflation Forecasting
High Fiscal Multipliers + Tight Labor Market = Inflation.
If Gov does massive stimulus when unemployment is 3% (e.g., US 2021) $\implies$ pure Inflation.
If Gov does stimulus when unemployment is 10% (e.g., 2009) $\implies$ Real Growth.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Leakage):**
Small open economy (Singapore). $m$ (Imports) is high.
Gov spends $100. Citizens buy Imports.
GDP of Singapore does not grow. GDP of Trading Partner grows.
Multiplier is low. Fiscal policy is ineffective in open economies.

**Exercise 2 (Japan):**
Construction State.
Built bridges to nowhere for 20 years.
Multiplier collapsed because utility of spending was 0.
Keynesian "Digging holes and filling them" boosts GDP math, but not Wealth.
