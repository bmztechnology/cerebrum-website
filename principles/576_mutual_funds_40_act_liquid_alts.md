# Mutual Funds 40 Act Liquid Alts

## I. Executive Summary

**Mutual Funds** (Open-Ended Investment Companies) are the primary vehicle for retail access to markets. Regulated under the **Investment Company Act of 1940** ("40 Act"), they offer daily liquidity, diversification, and strict transparency. **Liquid Alts** are hedge fund strategies wrapped in a mutual fund structure, offering retail investors access to Long/Short or Managed Futures, but constrained by leverage and liquidity rules.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Net Asset Value - NAV)
Calculated daily at 4:00 PM.
$NAV = (Assets - Liabilities) / Shares$.
Transactions occur at forward NAV. (No intraday trading).

### Definition 2.2 (40 Act Constraints)
**Liquidity:** Must pay redemption in 7 days. Limit illiquids to 15%.
**Leverage:** Max 33% (Asset Coverage 300%).
**Diversification:** 5/10/40 Rule.
These constraints dilute Hedge Fund strategies (Liquid Alts often underperform private counterparts).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Active vs Passive
The great migration.
Active Mutual Funds (Stock Picking) losing assets to Passive (Index).
Fee drag (>1%) makes beating the index mathematically hard.
"Closet Indexing": Charging active fees for index-like performance.

### 3.2 Share Classes
Class A: Front-end load (Sales commission).
Class C: Level load.
Institutional (I): No load, low fee, high minimum.
Clean Shares (RDR in UK): Unbundled advice fee.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Interval Funds
Hybrid.
Not daily liquidity (Quarterly redemptions of 5-25%).
Allows uniform investing in Illiquids (Credit, Real Estate).
Bridge between Mutual Fund and Private Fund.

### 4.2 Tax Efficiency
Mutual funds must distribute Capital Gains annually.
Investor pays tax even if they didn't sell ("Phantom Income").
ETFs are more tax efficient (In-kind creation/redemption).
Mutual funds structurally disadvantaged in taxable accounts.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Survivor Bias in Data):**
Looking at Morningstar Category average.
Excludes funds that died (underperformers).
Average performance looks better than reality.

**Exercise 2 (Turnover):**
High turnover $\implies$ High tax bill + High transaction costs.
"Portfolio Turnover Ratio."
Low turnover (Buy and Hold) generally preferred.
