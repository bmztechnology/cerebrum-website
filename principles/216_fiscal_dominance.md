# Fiscal Dominance: When Politics Captures Money

## I. Executive Summary

**Fiscal Dominance** occurs when the Fiscal Authority (Government) becomes so indebted that the Monetary Authority (Central Bank) loses the ability to target inflation. The Central Bank is forced to keep interest rates low to prevent sovereign default, effectively monetizing the debt. The separation of powers collapses, and the Central Bank becomes an arm of the Treasury.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Constraint)
$$r < g$$
Must be maintained artificially.
If Inflation spikes, Fed *should* raise rates to $r > g$ to cool economy.
But raising rates bankrupts the Govt (Interest Expense > Tax Revenue).
Fed *chooses* to keep $r$ low.
Result: Inflation spirals.

### Definition 2.2 (The Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic)
Sargent & Wallace (1981).
If Fiscal Policy is unsustainable.
Tight Monetary Policy today (fighting inflation) leads to HIGHER inflation tomorrow.
Why? Tight money increases debt accumulation (higher interest).
Eventually, huge debt requires huge printing to pay off.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regime Change
System moves from "Monetary Dominance" (Volcker 1980s: Fed is King) to "Fiscal Dominance" (Post-2020: Treasury is King).
Policy is driven by "Funding the Deficit" not "Stable Prices."

### 3.2 Financial Repression 2.0
Fiscal Dominance REQUIRES Financial Repression.
Negative Real Rates are the mechanism to transfer wealth to the state.
It is the "Soft Default."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Asset Class implication
In Monetary Dominance: Bonds are a hedge (Deflation risk).
In Fiscal Dominance: Bonds are the risk (Inflation/Default risk).
Correlation Stock/Bond turns Positive (Both fall together).
The "60/40 Portfolio" dies.

### 4.2 Gold & Bitcoin
These are the only assets with no counterparty risk to the State.
Fiscal Dominance is the Bull signal for Hard Assets.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (UK 2022):**
Truss Budget.
BOE was trying to Sell Bonds (QT).
Truss crash forced BOE to Buy Bonds (QE) to save pensions.
Fiscal instability forced Monetary reversal. Dominance proved.

**Exercise 2 (The Endgame):**
History shows Fiscal Dominance ends in Currency Reform or High Inflation.
It rarely ends in "Austerity and payoff."
Betting on "Responsible Government" is a losing trade historically.
