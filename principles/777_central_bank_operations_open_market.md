# Central Bank Operations Open Market

## I. Executive Summary

Central Banks (Fed, ECB, BOJ) are the "Whales" of the fixed income and FX markets. Their **Open Market Operations (OMO)**—buying and selling securities to target interest rates—dominate liquidity conditions. Microstructure must account for the **Fed Put**, **QE Flows** (insensitive buying), and **Repo Facility** floors. They act as the **Market Maker of Last Resort**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Quantitative Easing - QE)
Fed buys Treasuries/MBS from Primary Dealers.
Credits Dealer's Reserve Account.
Effect: Removes Duration risk from market. Increases Cash.
Microstructure: Fed buys via specific "Operations" (schedule).
Dealers front-run the Fed schedule?
"Pass-through" operation.

### Definition 2.2 (The Zero Lower Bound ZLB)
When rates hit 0%.
Standard OMO (buying T-Bills) loses traction.
Unconventional Policy (buying Long Bonds) flattens the curve.
Yield Curve Control (YCC): BOJ pegs 10Y yield at 0%.
Infinite bid at a specific price. LOB depth $\to \infty$.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Forcing Liquidity
During crisis, Dealers stop quoting.
Fed steps in. "SMCCF" (Corp Bond buying).
Fed became the Buyer of LQD ETF.
Signal: "We will not let spreads widen."
Front-running the Fed becomes the only alpha.
"Don't Fight the Fed."

### 3.2 The Plunge Protection Team?
Working Group on Financial Markets.
Do they buy Futures during crashes?
Conspiracy vs Reality.
Central Banks *do* intervene in FX (e.g., BOJ selling USD/JPY).
Visible interventions vs Oral interventions ("Jawboning").

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the POMO
Permanent Open Market Operations.
Fed publishes schedule (Days, Times, CUSIPs).
Dealers accummulate targeted bonds ahead of time.
Sell to Fed at premium (Ask price).
Profitable, low risk flow trading.

### 4.2 Predicting Taper Tantrums
When Fed stops buying.
Liquidity dependence (Addiction) withdrawal.
Volatility spikes.
VaR models fail because they were trained on QE-suppressed regimes.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (YCC Break):**
Australia targeted 3Y yield.
Market attacked the peg.
RBA gave up. Yield spiked.
"Soros trade" against Central Banks.
Microstructure: Selling into the infinite bid until the bid pulls.

**Exercise 2 (The Reverse Repo Counter):**
Watch the RRP usage daily (NY Fed site).
$2 Trillion usage.
Means massive excess liquidity in system.
Bullish for assets? Or just broken plumbing?
