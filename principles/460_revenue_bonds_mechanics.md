# Revenue Bonds Mechanics: Project Finance

## I. Executive Summary

**Revenue Bonds** are backed *only* by the specific revenues stemming from a project (e.g., Tolls from a Turnpike, Landing Fees from an Airport, Water Bills). They are **Non-Recourse** to the general taxing power. Credit analysis focuses on **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** and the essentiality of the service. They comprise the majority (~60%) of the Muni market.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Waterfall)
Flow of Funds:
1.  **Gross Revenues.**
2.  **O&M (Operations & Maintenance):** Pay workers, electricity. (Essential to keep asset running).
3.  **Net Revenues.**
4.  **Debt Service (Sinking Fund):** Pay Bondholders.
5.  **Reserve Fund:** Replenish if needed.
6.  **Surplus:** To the City/General Fund.
Note: "Net Revenue Pledge" (Standard). "Gross Revenue Pledge" (Bondholders paid *before* O&M) is rare and dangerous (Asset might decay).

### Definition 2.2 (Rate Covenant)
Issuer promises to raise rates (Tolls/Fees) if DSCR falls below 1.25x.
Monopoly power allows this.
Limit: Elasticity of demand. If toll too high, drivers take side roads.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Essential Service
Water/Sewer: Most essential. High ratings (AA/AAA). People pay water bill before credit card.
Airports: Essential for commerce. Cyclical (Covid travel ban).
Hospitals: Competitive. Reimbursement risk (Medicare). Lower ratings.

### 3.2 Private Activity
If >10% of benefit goes to private entity.
Stadium bonds.
Subject to AMT.
Risk: Team leaves city.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Prepaid Gas Bonds
Municipal Utility buys 30 years of Natural Gas from a Bank.
Issues Bond to pay for it.
Structure involves complex Swaps.
Yields higher than typical revenue bonds.

### 4.2 Transportation
Toll Roads.
Traffic Studies (ramp-up risk).
"Greenfield" (New road) vs "Brownfield" (Existing road).
Greenfield default rates are high.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Additional Bonds Test - ABT):**
Issuer cannot issue *new* parity debt unless revenues are sufficient.
Protects existing bondholders from dilution.
Historical Test vs Projected Test.

**Exercise 2 (The Flow Back):**
Airport revenues cannot flow back to the City (FAA rules).
Ring-fenced.
Protects Airport bonds from City bankruptcy.
(See: Detroit Airport bonds traded at par while City defaulted).
