# Factor Allocation Model: Building Blocks

## I. Executive Summary

**Factor Allocation** treats Factors (Value, Momentum, Carry, Volatility) as the fundamental atoms of risk, rather than Asset Classes (Stocks, Bonds). Since Asset Classes are just bundles of factors (e.g., Private Equity = Equity Beta + Small Cap + Illiquidity + Leverage), viewing the portfolio through a **Factor Lens** reveals hidden concentrations and allows for more precise engineering of risk premia.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Factor Decomposition)
Review Portfolio:
-   US Equity Fund.
-   Hedge Fund A.
-   REIT Fund.
Regression Analysis reveals:
-   90% Equity Beta.
-   10% Rates Beta.
-   Negative Momentum.
The "Diversified" portfolio is actually just one big bet on Beta.

### Definition 2.2 (Tilting)
Strategic Tilt: Permanent overweight to Value (belief in long term premium).
Tactical Tilt: Timing factors (Buying Momentum when trend is strong).
Completeness Portfolio: Adding a factor (e.g., Quality) to offset the unintentional factor bet of existing managers (e.g., Junk bias).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Orthogonality
Ideal Factors are orthogonal (uncorrelated).
Macro Factors (Growth, Inflation) vs Style Factors (Value, Mom).
Style Factors often persist across Macro regimes (e.g., Momentum works in Bull and Bear).
They provide "Orthogonal Alpha."

### 3.2 Crowding
Factors can become expensive.
Valuation of the Factor itself.
"Value Spread" (Price of Cheap / Price of Expensive).
When Value Spread is tight, Value factor is expensive (crowded). Avoid.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Liquid Alts
Replacing expensive Hedge Funds with Factor ETFs.
Hedge Fund = Alpha?
Or Hedge Fund = leveraged Carry + Short Vol?
If the latter, replicate cheaply.

### 4.2 MSP (Minimum Spanning Portfolio)
Using factors to span the efficient frontier.
Understanding that "Asset Allocation" is mostly just "Beta Allocation."
True diversification comes from factors.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Private Equity Mapping):**
PE Returns $R^2$ with Small Cap Value + Leverage.
Allocating to PE is implicitly allocating to Small-Value Factor.
Adjust public portfolio to avoid doubling up.

**Exercise 2 (Risk Parity as Factor Parity):**
Equalizing risk across Growth/Inflation/Rates assets.
True Factor diversification.
