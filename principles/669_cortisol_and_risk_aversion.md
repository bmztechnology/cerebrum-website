# Cortisol and Risk Aversion

## I. Executive Summary

**Cortisol** is the stress hormone released by the adrenal cortex in response to threat (**Volatility**, **Losses**). Acute cortisol prepares the body for "Fight or Flight," but **Chronic Cortisol** (from prolonged drawdowns) rewires the brain to become **Hyper-Risk Averse**, impairing memory and cognitive flexibility. This creates the "Rationality Deficit" seen in bear markets.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Coates Hypothesis)
Coates & Herbert (2008).
Trader Cortisol levels correlate with market volatility.
Sustained high cortisol leads to "Learned Helplessness."
Risk appetite collapses.
The "Market Bottom" forms when the collective cortisol is so high that no one can physically pull the trigger to buy.

### Definition 2.2 (Cognitive Shut-Down)
Cortisol inhibits the Prefrontal Cortex (System 2) and stimulates the Amygdala (System 1).
"Analysis Paralysis."
Traders stare at the screen but cannot execute.
Information processing speed drops.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Winner Effect vs The Loser Effect
Testosterone (Winner) vs Cortisol (Loser).
Winning increases T $\implies$ Confidence $\implies$ More Risk.
Losing increases C $\implies$ Fear $\implies$ Less Risk.
Biology amplifies Momentum.

### 3.2 Physiological Limits
There is a biological limit to how much stress a trader can endure.
"Burnout."
Adrenal fatigue.
Professional trading firms manage "Biological Capital" (Mandatory vacations).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Stress Management
Exercise metabolizes Cortisol.
Cardio after a trading session clears the "stress debt."
Sitting in a chair stewing in Cortisol is toxic.

### 4.2 The "Stop Loss" for the Body
Monitor physical symptoms: Shaking hands, Insomnia, Irritability.
Signals that C-levels are too high for rational decision making.
Rule: "If I can't sleep, I cut position size by 50%."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (HRV Monitoring):**
Heart Rate Variability.
Low HRV is a proxy for high Cortisol/Stress.
Use Whoop/Oura ring.
If HRV is huge red, don't trade PnL.

**Exercise 2 (The Walk Away):**
After a big loss, cortisol spikes.
Do not "Revenge Trade" (which is actually a desperate attempt to lower cortisol via relief).
Walk away for 2 hours.
Let the half-life of the hormone pass.
