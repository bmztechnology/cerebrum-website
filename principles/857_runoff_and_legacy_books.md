# Run off and Legacy Book Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

**Run-off** (Legacy) consolidators acquire "Dead" insurance books—policies that are no longer written but still have liabilities (e.g., Asbestos, Environmental). Firms like **Enstar** and **Catalina** specialize in **Claims Management** (settling for less) and **Asset Management** (investing the float). It is the "Distressed Debt" equivalent of the insurance world.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (IBNR - Incurred But Not Reported)
The "Dark Matter" of insurance.
Asbestos claim filed 40 years after exposure.
Run-off acquirer bets that: booked IBNR > Actual future payouts.
Profit = Reserve Redundancy + Investment Income.

### Definition 2.2 (Commutation)
Negotiated buyout of a reinsurance contract.
Insurer and Reinsurer agree to settle all future obligations for a lump sum today.
"Clean break."
Run-off firms are aggressive commutators.
Settle claims for cash now to close the book.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Valuation Gap
Insurer wants to sell Legacy book to free up Capital (Solvency II).
Buyer wants to buy to access Float.
Price = Book Value - Discount.
Discount reflects uncertainty risk.
If Buyer has better claims data/lawyers, they have an edge.

### 3.2 Finality
 Rhode Island Regulation 68.
 "Insurance Business Transfer" (IBT).
 Allows legal transfer of liabilities to a new entity (with Court approval).
 Original insurer is fully released.
 Makes the US market more like UK (Part VII Transfer).
 Liquid market for liabilities.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Hunting Zombies
Finding insurers with "Long Tail" pain.
Offer LPT (Loss Portfolio Transfer).
Take the pain away (for a fee).
Turn the float into Alpha.

### 4.2 Pseudo-Endowment
A closed book is a closed pool of capital.
No new premiums. No marketing costs.
Just Claims and Investments.
Pure asset management play.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Asbestos Survival):**
Mesothelioma payments.
Wave was expected to end by 2020.
It didn't.
New defendants (Talc).
Run-off firms that under-reserved took hits.

**Exercise 2 (Environmental Liability):**
Pollution cleanup.
EPA rules change.
Liability expands.
Active management (Engineering solutions) needed to contain claims.
