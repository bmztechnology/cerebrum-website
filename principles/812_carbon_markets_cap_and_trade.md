# Carbon Markets Cap and Trade

## I. Executive Summary

**Carbon Markets** (EU ETS, California CCA) put a price on negative externalities ($CO_2$). The government sets a **Cap** (Supply), and industries trade **Allowances** (EUA, CCA). The microstructure resembles a central bank for carbon: Regulators use **Auctions** and **Market Stability Reserves (MSR)** to manage volatility and steer the price toward a decarbonization trajectory.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cap and Trade)
Cap declines annually (Linear Reduction Factor).
Supply squeezes over time.
Polluters must surrender 1 Allowance per ton emitted.
If Emissions > Allowances held $\implies$ Buy in market or pay Fine (€100 + Buying cost).
Fine acts as Price Ceiling? No, because you still have to buy. It's a penalty + restitution.

### Definition 2.2 (Offsets vs Allowances)
**Allowance (EUA):** Permission to emit. Finite regulatory supply. High quality.
**Offset (VCM):** Verified removal/avoidance (Planting trees). Infinite theoretical supply. Low/Variable quality.
Most compliance markets restrict Offsets (EU bans them).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Fuel Switching Price
Spread between Coal and Gas.
Coal emits 2x Carbon of Gas.
Carbon Price ($P_c$) drives the switch.
Switch Price: $P_c$ where Cost(Gas Generation) = Cost(Coal Generation).
If $P_c$ > Switch Price, Coal shuts down.
"Abatement Curve."

### 3.2 Political Microstructure
Governments want High Price (Decarbonization) but not Too High (Industry flight/Leakage).
Free Allocation: Give allowances to Steel/Cement to prevent them moving to China.
CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism): Tax imports based on carbon content. End of Free Allocation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The MSR Squeeze
Market Stability Reserve.
Algorithm withdraws allowances if Surplus > Threshold.
Injects if Surplus < Threshold.
Designed to support price.
Turned EU ETS into a "One Way Bet" (Supply shrinking).

### 4.2 Correlation Trading
Carbon correlates with Gas Prices (in Europe).
High Gas $\implies$ Switch to Coal $\implies$ Higher Emissions $\implies$ Higher Carbon Demand.
Correlation break: If Recession (Industrial output drop) $\implies$ Carbon crashes (2009, 2020).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Tesla Alpha):**
Tesla sells Regulatory Credits (ZEV) to Ford/GM.
100% margin revenue.
Historically made the difference between profit and loss.
Carbon finance subsidizing EV production.

**Exercise 2 (Greenwashing Arbitrage):**
Buy "Junk" Offsets (\$1).
Wrap them in "Crypto Carbon" token (BCT).
Sell to naive DeFi users.
Price collapsed when Verra discredited the offsets.
Quality arbitrage.
