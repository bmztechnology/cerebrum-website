# Ostrich Effect Information Avoidance

## I. Executive Summary

The **Ostrich Effect** (Galai & Sade) describes the tendency for investors to "bury their head in the sand" during bad markets. They check their portfolios significantly **less often** when markets are down, avoiding the psychological pain of seeing red numbers. This **Selective Exposure** to information hinders timely risk management and rebalancing.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Login Frequency)
Karlsson, Loewenstein, Seppi (2009).
S&P 500 UP $\implies$ Logins UP (5-8%).
S&P 500 DOWN $\implies$ Logins DOWN.
"Monitoring is a consumption good."
We consume good news (Utility positive). We avoid bad news (Utility negative).

### Definition 2.2 (Strategic Ignorance)
Avoiding the dentist because you fear a cavity.
Avoiding the statement because you fear the margin call.
Rational ignorance? No, because the cost of ignorance (compounding problems) is high.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Anticipatory Utility
We derive utility not just from consumption, but from *anticipation*.
Looking at a winning portfolio creates "Savoring."
Looking at a losing one creates "Dread."
We manage our mood by curating our inputs.

### 3.2 The Long Term Investor Defense
"I'm a long term investor, I don't need to look."
Valid *if* the allocation is correct.
Often used as an excuse to ignore necessary actions (e.g., Tax Loss Harvesting).
Ostrich behavior during 2008 meant missing the chance to rebalance (Buy low).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Push Notifications
Broker apps weaponize the anti-Ostrich.
"Your portfolio is down 5%" notification.
Forces attention.
Can lead to Panic Selling (See "Myopic Loss Aversion").
Maybe Ostrich is a good defense against over-trading?

### 4.2 The Reality Check
Advisor role.
"We need to meet."
Forcing the client to face the reality.
Restructuring the portfolio based on current facts, not past hopes.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Password Reset):**
Anecdote involving higher rates of "Forgot Password" requests during Bull Markets?
Actually, many people *lose* access during bear markets subconsciously.

**Exercise 2 (Liquidity Drying):**
In illiquid markets (Housing), sellers don't list.
They become ostriches.
"If I don't list, I haven't lost value."
Volume creates the price. No volume = No price = No loss?
