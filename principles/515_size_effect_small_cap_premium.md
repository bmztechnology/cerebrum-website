# Size Effect Small Cap Premium: The Ghost

## I. Executive Summary

The **Size Effect** (Small Caps outperform Large Caps) was the first anomaly added to CAPM (Fama-French, 1993). Historically, small firms earned higher returns. However, since its discovery (and publication), the premium has statistically vanished in major markets, or become sporadic. Modern research suggests the Size Premium is concentrated in **Micro-Caps** and requires controlling for **Quality** ("Junk" small caps destroy the average).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (SMB Construction)
Divide universe into Small (Bottom 30% Market Cap) and Big (Top 30%).
$$ SMB = R_{Small} - R_{Big} $$
Factor has high autocorrelation? No. Very noisy.

### Definition 2.2 (Liquidity Premium)
Is Size just Illiquidity?
Small caps trade less. Higher Bid-Ask spread. Market Impact cost.
The "Premium" might just be transaction costs preventing arbitrage.
Computed returns do not reflect realizable returns for large funds.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The January Effect
Historically, most of the Small Cap premium occurred in January.
Tax-loss selling in Dec (pummeling small losers) followed by rebound in Jan.
Arbitrageurs now front-run this (buying in Dec). Effect diminished.

### 3.2 "Size as an Amplifier"
Size itself is not a factor. It amplifies other factors.
Value works better in Small Caps.
Momentum works better in Small Caps.
Quality works better in Small Caps.
Why? Less efficient pricing / less analyst coverage in small names.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Russell 2000 vs S&P 500
Standard Small Cap Trade.
Russell 2000 contains many unprofitable companies (Biotech, Zombie firms).
S&P 600 (Small Cap) requires profitability for inclusion.
S&P 600 consistently outperforms Russell 2000.
Lesson: Screen for Quality in Small Caps.

### 4.2 The "Small Cap Value" Holy Grail
Fama-French/DFA philosophy.
Small + Value = Highest expected return bucket.
High volatility, huge drawdowns, but massive long-run CAGR.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Capacity Constraints):**
Can a \$100B fund invest in Small Caps?
No. Owning 5% of a \$500M company is \$25M. Need 4000 names.
Active management scales poorly in Small Caps.
Passive/Systematic dominates.

**Exercise 2 (IPO Dilution):**
Small Cap index returns are hurt by IPOs entering (usually growthy/expensive).
And successful Small Caps graduating to Mid/Large Caps.
"Rebalancing Drag"? Or "Winner Harvesting"?
Actually, winners leaving the index helps (Selling high).
