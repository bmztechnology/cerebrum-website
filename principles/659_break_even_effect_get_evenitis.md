# Break Even Effect Get Evenitis

## I. Executive Summary

The **Break-Even Effect** is the tendency for traders who have effectively lost money to become **Risk Seeking** in an attempt to get back to zero ("Break Even"). It is a manifestation of **Loss Aversion** (the pain of finalizing a loss) combined with **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. It leads to "Doubling Down" on losers and often results in catastrophic ruin (Martingale strategies).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Prospect Theory in the Loss Domain)
Utility function is convex in losses (Risk Seeking).
Trader is at -\$1,000.
Choice A: Realize -\$1,000 (Certainty).
Choice B: 50% chance of \$0, 50% chance of -\$2,000.
Trader picks B.
"Getting back to zero" is the dominant psychological goal.

### Definition 2.2 (The "Get-Even" Trade)
Increasing position size as equity drops.
"Revenge Trading."
Abandoning the edge to serve the ego.
The reference point remains the High Water Mark (HWM), not current equity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Thaler and Johnson (1990)
Distinction between House Money (Risk seeking after gain) and Break-Even (Risk seeking after loss).
Both lead to risk seeking but for different reasons.
Break-exchange is driven by desperation/pain avoidance.

### 3.2 The Spiraling Mechanic
Loss $\to$ Anxiety $\to$ Narrowing of Focus (Tunnel Vision) $\to$ High Variance Bet.
If Bet wins: Relief (Negative Reinforcement of bad habit).
If Bet loses: Ruin.
Survival bias hides the ruin.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Resetting the Anchor
Mental Hack: "If I didn't have this position, would I enter it today?"
If No $\implies$ Sell.
Forcing the reference point to Current Market Price (Mark-to-Market).

### 4.2 Hard Stops
The only cure for Get-Evenitis is pre-commitment.
Broker-enforced daily loss limits.
"You can't trade until tomorrow."
Cooling off the Amygdala.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Martingale):**
Blackjack. Doubling bet after every loss.
Works until you hit table limit or run out of cash.
In markets, the "Table Limit" is liquidity/margin.
A Break-Even strategy guarantees eventual bankruptcy.

**Exercise 2 (The "Scratch"):**
Trader is down slightly. Market moves back to entry.
Trader exits immediately: "I scratched it."
Relief.
But maybe the trade was now good (Momentum)?
Exiting for emotional relief vs profit maximization.
