# Central Bank Swap Lines: The Global Safety Net

## I. Executive Summary

**Swap Lines** are agreements between Central Banks to exchange currencies. The Federal Reserve provides Dollars to the ECB (European Central Bank) in exchange for Euros. This allows the ECB to lend Dollars to European banks during a "Dollar Shortage." These lines are the "break glass in case of emergency" tool that prevents a global financial cardiac arrest.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Structure)
1.  Fed sends $10B USD to ECB.
2.  ECB sends €9B EUR to Fed (at current spot rate).
3.  ECB lends $10B to Deutsche Bank (who is short dollars).
4.  Deutsche Bank repays ECB later.
5.  ECB repays Fed (at ORIGINAL spot rate).
**No Exchange Rate Risk** for the Central Banks.

### Definition 2.2 (C6 Standing Lines)
The core network: Fed, ECB, BOJ, BOE, SNB, BOC.
These 6 have permanent, unlimited swap lines.
Emerging Markets (Brazil, Mexico) have limited, temporary lines.
Using a swap line is a sign of acute stress.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Lender of Last Resort (International)
The Fed is the de facto Central Bank of the World.
Global Trade is in Dollars.
When crises hit, everyone hoards Dollars.
If Fed refuses to supply dollars offshore, the Global Banking system collapses (2008).
Swap Lines = Fed accepting its imperial burden.

### 3.2 FIMA Repo Facility
For countries without Swap Lines.
They can deposit Treasuries with the Fed to get Cash overnight.
Prevents them from fire-selling Treasuries (which would spike yields).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Crisis Indicator
Monitor "US Dollar Liquidity Swaps" on Fed Balance Sheet (FRED Data).
Zero = Normal.
Spike (e.g., $400B in 2008, $60B in 2020) = Panic.
When Swaps are open, Short Equities? No, usually the Fed action marks the *bottom* of the panic.

### 4.2 The Hierachy
Tier 1: C6 (Swap Lines).
Tier 2: FIMA (Repo Facility).
Tier 3: The Rest (Must sell reserves/IMF).
Invest in Tier 1/2 countries. Avoid Tier 3 in crises.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Swiss 2022):**
Credit Suisse collapse.
SNB used Fed Swap Lines for $11 Billion.
Why? CS needed Dollars to pay escaping clients.
Without Swap Line, CS would have defaulted on Dollar obligations.

**Exercise 2 (Politics):**
China does NOT have a Fed Swap Line.
Russia does NOT.
The Swap Network is a "NATO of Finance."
You are either inside the tent or outside.
