# Estate Planning Trusts Structures

## I. Executive Summary

**Estate Planning** focuses on the efficient transfer of wealth to the next generation, minimizing **Estate Taxes** (Death Tax) and ensuring **Control**. Trusts are the primary vehicle, separating Legal Title (Trustee) from Beneficial Interest (Beneficiary). For UHNW clients, Estate Planning is often more important than Investment Management due to the 40% Estate Tax rate in the US.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Revocable vs Irrevocable)
**Revocable (Living Trust):** Avoids Probate. Private. No Tax benefit (Still in estate).
**Irrevocable:** Assets removed from Estate. Tax efficient. Loss of control.
GRANTOR pays income tax (Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust - IDGT).
Allows trust assets to grow tax-free (Grantor pays tax burn).

### Definition 2.2 (Step-Up in Basis)
Assets held at death get basis adjusted to Market Value.
Capital Gains erased.
"Buy, Borrow, Die" strategy relies on this.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 GRAT (Grantor Retained Annuity Trust)
Split interest.
Grantor puts asset in.
Takes annuity stream back = Value of asset + IRS Interest Rate (7520 rate).
Remainder = 0 (Gift Tax is 0).
If Asset Return > IRS Rate $\implies$ Excess passes to kids Tax Free.
"Heads I win, Tails I break even."

### 3.2 Valuation Discounts
Family Limited Partnership (FLP).
Put assets in FLP. Gift shares of FLP to kids.
Claim "Lack of Marketability Discount" (30%).
Discounted transfer of wealth.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Dynasty Trusts
Perpetual.
Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) exemption.
Assets stay in trust forever, avoiding estate tax at every generation.
"Compound interest for 100 years."

### 4.2 Asset Protection
Creditors (Lawsuits, ex-spouses) cannot seize Irrevocable Trust assets.
"Spendthrift Clause."
Protecting heirs from themselves.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The 7520 Rate):**
Low interest rate environment favors GRATs/CLATs.
High interest rate environment favors QPRTs.
Interest rate sensitivity of planning tools.

**Exercise 2 (Trustee Selection):**
Corporate Trustee (Bank) vs Uncle Bob.
Banks charge fees but are neutral/professional.
Family members bring drama.
