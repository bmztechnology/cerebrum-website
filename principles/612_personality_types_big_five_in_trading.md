# Personality Types Big Five in Trading

## I. Executive Summary

Individual **Personality Traits** significantly predict trading performance and biases. Psychometric models, particularly the **Big Five (OCEAN)**, reveal that high **Neuroticism** correlates with poor performance (panic selling), while high **Conscientiousness** correlates with rule adherence. Understanding one's personality profile is a prerequisite for selecting a compatible trading strategy (e.g., Impulsive people should not Scalp).
