# The Trading Psychology Plan

## I. Executive Summary

A **Trading Psychology Plan** is as critical as the Trading Strategy itself. It defines the "Emotional Rules of Engagement." Just as a Risk Management plan defines dollar limits, a Psychology Plan defines **Emotional Limits** (e.g., "Stop trading if tilted"). It incorporates **Pre-Game Routines**, **In-Game Checks**, and **Post-Game Analysis** to maintain peak cognitive state (System 2).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The HALT Trigger)
Acronym: **H**ungry, **A**ngry, **L**onely, **T**ired.
Rule: If any of these are true $\implies$ DO NOT TRADE.
Physiological state determines psychological resilience.

### Definition 2.2 (The Circuit Breaker)
Software or personal rule.
"If I lose 3 trades in a row, I must walk away for 1 hour."
Breaks the Dopamine loop of loss chasing.
Preventing specific spirals (Tilt).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Mental Capital
Defined as the reserve of willpower and emotional resilience.
Every decision burns mental capital.
Every loss burns mental capital.
When Capital < 0, decision quality collapses.
The Plan aims to conserve and replenish Mental Capital.

### 3.2 Implementation Intentions
"If-Then" planning (Gollwitzer).
"If I feel my heart rate spike, THEN I will close the position."
Pre-loading the decision creates an automatic response during stress (System 1), overriding the paralysis.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Pre-Market Checklist
1. Review overnight news.
2. Review technical levels.
3. **Review Internal State:** "Am I calm? Am I focused?"
4. Visualization: "Visualize losing today. How will I react?" (Stoic Premeditatio Malorum).

### 4.2 Handling Drawdowns
The Plan must specify what happens in a 20% drawdown.
"reduce size by 50% until Watermark is recovered."
"Switch to Paper Trading."
Psychological protection: prevents the "Hail Mary" trade that blows up the account.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Emotional Thermometer):**
Rate stress 1-10 every hour.
If > 7 $\implies$ Flat all positions.
Data collection on personal stress tolerance.

**Exercise 2 (The "Why" Card):**
Post-it note on monitor.
"Why am I entering this trade?"
Forces verbalization of rationale.
If answer is "I need to make money," cancel trade.
