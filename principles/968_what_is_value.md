# What is Value Objective vs Subjective

## I. Executive Summary

The history of economics is a war between **Objective Value Theory** (Labor Theory of Value - Marx/Smith) and **Subjective Value Theory** (Marginal Utility - Austrian School). Finance is the practical application of **Subjectivism**: a stock is worth \$100 simply because someone is willing to pay \$100, regardless of the "labor" inside the company. The synthesis argues that "Intrinsic Value" is a myth; all value is a social consensus.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Labor Theory of Value)
Value = Amount of Labor Hours required to produce it.
Problem: If I spend 1000 hours making a mud pie, it has no value.
Marx tried to patch this with "Socially Necessary Labor Time."
Still fails to explain why Water (low labor) is cheap but Diamonds (medium labor) are expensive.

### Definition 2.2 (Subjective Theory of Value)
Menger/Jevons/Walras (Marginal Revolution).
Value is in the mind of the beholder.
Depends on **Marginal Utility** (How much do I want one *more* unit).
Water has low marginal utility (abundant). Diamonds have high.
Price determines Cost (not vice versa).
If people pay \$1000 for iPhone, Apple can afford expensive parts.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Paradox of Value
Why do essential things cost little and useless things cost much?
Abundance vs Scarcity.
Air is free (Infinite supply, but infinite utility).
Bitcoin is expensive (Fixed supply, debatable utility).
Value = Utility $\times$ Scarcity.

### 3.2 The Keynesian Beauty Contest Revisited
Keynes understood Subjectivism perfectly.
"We are not picking the prettiest face. We are picking the face others think is prettiest."
Value is a Recursive Belief Function.
$V_t = E_t [ V_{t+1} ]$.
If everyone believes it will have value tomorrow, it has value today.
Fiat Money works on this principle.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 "Intrinsic Value" (Buffett)
Buffett calculates DCF. "Intrinsic Value."
Is this Objective?
No. It is a Subjective estimate of future cash flows and risk.
It is an "Anchor" for his own psychology.
If Market Price < His Anchor, he buys.
But if the world changes (AI), his Anchor might be wrong.

### 4.2 Luxury Goods Valuation
Veblen Goods. Demand increases as Price increases.
Patek Philippe watch.
Value comes *from* the high price (Exclusivity).
Pure Subjectivity.
Shorting companies with weak "Brand Mojo" (Subjective power).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The NFT Boom):**
JPEG of a rock sells for \$1M.
Objective Value: 0 (Pixels).
Subjective Value: \$1M (Status / Community membership).
Is it a bubble? Or a pure expression of Subjective Value?
If the community dies, value $\to$ 0.

**Exercise 2 (Post-Scarcity Economy):**
If AI makes "Stuff" free (Objective cost $\to$ 0).
Where does value go?
To things that cannot be copied.
Land. Attention. Trust.
Subjective value dominates in a world of abundance.
