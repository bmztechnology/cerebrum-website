# Emerging Market Hard Currency: Original Sin

## I. Executive Summary

**Hard Currency Debt** (External Debt) is issued by Emerging Markets in USD or EUR. This attracts foreign capital but exposes the sovereign to **FX Risk**. The "Original Sin" hypothesis states that if a country cannot borrow in its own currency, it must face a mismatch: Revenues in Local Currency (Tax), Liabilities in Hard Currency (Debt). Depreciation leads to solvency crises.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Eurobonds)
Bonds issued in a currency *other* than that of the issuer's country.
e.g., Brazil issuing USD bonds.
Regulated by International Law (usually NY or English Law), not local law.
Crucial for creditor protection (harder to default by changing local statute).

### Definition 2.2 (Sovereign Ceiling)
Corporate issuers in EM usually capped at Sovereign rating.
If Sovereign defaults (imposes FX controls), Corporates cannot pay USD debt even if they have the cash.
Transfer and Convertibility (T&C) Risk.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Debt Sustainability
$$ \Delta d = (r - g)d - pb $$
-   $d$: Debt/GDP.
-   $r$: Real interest rate.
-   $g$: Real GDP growth.
-   $pb$: Primary Balance (Surplus/Deficit).
If Borrowing in USD: $r$ includes FX devaluation.
If Currency drops 50%, Debt/GDP doubles overnight.

### 3.2 Spread Decomposition
Yield = US Treasury + Country Risk Premium.
Premium = Default Risk + Liquidity Risk.
EMBI (JP Morgan Index) tracks these spreads.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Crossover Investors
IG funds that dip into BB rated Sovereigns (Mexico, Brazil) for yield.
"Tourist Capital."
First to flee in a crisis.

### 4.2 Distressed EM
Venezuela, Lebanon, Sri Lanka.
Bonds trade at 5-10 cents.
Option value on regime change or restructuring.
Recovery takes decades.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Negative Correlation):**
USD Up $\implies$ EM Assets Down.
"Dollar Wrecking Ball."
EM Central Banks forced to hike rates to defend currency, killing growth.

**Exercise 2 (Amortization Humps):**
Wall of maturity.
Country X has \$5B due in 2024. Reserves \$2B. Markets closed.
Default inevitable unless IMF steps in.
