# Accruals Anomaly Sloan

## I. Executive Summary

The **Accruals Anomaly** (Sloan 1996) states that companies with high **Accruals** (Non-cash earnings) underperform companies with low accruals (High Cash Flow). Investors fixate on headline **Net Income**, failing to distinguish between the **Quality** of earnings (Cash) and the **Manipulation** of earnings (Accruals). It is a pure test of accounting literacy vs behavioral fixation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Total Accruals)
$$ Accruals = (\Delta CA - \Delta Cash) - (\Delta CL - \Delta STD) - Dep $$
Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Short Term Debt, Depreciation.
Roughly: $NetIncome = CashFlow + Accruals$.
High Accruals $\implies$ Earnings driven by Inventory build or Accounts Receivable (Sales not yet collected).

### Definition 2.2 (Persistence)
Cash Flow is highly persistent (stable).
Accruals are not persistent (mean reverting).
Investors assume Accruals are as persistent as Cash.
They overvalue High Accrual firms.
When Accruals reverse (Write-downs), stock crashes.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Earnings Management
Managers use discretionary accruals to "smooth" earnings or hit targets.
"Stuffing the channel" (Boosting receivables).
"Cookie Jar Reserves."
Sloan's strategy effectively shorts aggressive accounting / fraud.

### 3.2 Limits to Arbitrage
Why does it persist?
Shorting High Accrual firms is dangerous (they might be high growth).
Requires extensive financial statement analysis (Costly information).
Quant funds have arbitraged it away in Large Caps, but it persists in Small Caps.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Quality Factor (QMJ)
Asness.
Accruals is a key component of "Quality."
Quality = Profitability + Safety + Payout + Growth.
Low Accruals = High Safety.

### 4.2 Forensic Alpha
CFRA / Muddy Waters.
Using accrual analysis to identify short targets.
"Divergence between Earnings and Cash Flow" is the #1 Red Flag.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Balance Sheet vs Income Statement):**
Income Statement says Profit = \$100M.
Balance Sheet says Cash = \$0, Receivables = \$100M.
Accrual Anomaly says: Short this stock.
The cash is a lie (or at least, a hope).

**Exercise 2 (Sector Bias):**
Tech companies (SaaS) have strange accruals (Deferred Revenue).
Deferred Revenue is a *good* accrual (Cash collected, service owed).
Simple Sloan model needs adjustment for SaaS.
