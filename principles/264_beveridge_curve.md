# Beveridge Curve: The Matching Function

## I. Executive Summary

The **Beveridge Curve** plots **Job Vacancies (V)** (y-axis) vs **Unemployment Rate (U)** (x-axis). It measures the efficiency of the labor market. A movement *along* the curve is cyclical (Boom = High V, Low U). A shift *of* the curve is structural (Mismatch). Post-COVID, the curve shifted outward, implying the labor market is "broken" – it takes more vacancies to fill a single job.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Curve Equation)
$$U = \frac{s}{s + f(\theta)}$$
-   $s$: Separation rate (Firing).
-   $f(\theta)$: Job finding rate.
-   $\theta = V/U$: Market Tightness.
Inverse relationship: High U should mean Low V (Recession).

### Definition 2.2 (Efficiency Shift)
If Curve shifts Out/Right:
For same Unemployment (e.g., 4%), Vacancies are higher (e.g., 8M vs 5M).
Reasons:
1.  **Skill Mismatch:** Vacancies for AI Coders, Unemployed represent Coal Miners.
2.  **Geographic Mismatch:** Jobs in Texas, Unemployed in Detroit.
3.  **Reduced Search Intensity:** "Great Resignation" / Benefits.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Soft Landing Path (Waller's Thesis)
Fed Governor Waller argued: We can reduce Inflation by lowering Vacancies (V) without raising Unemployment (U).
Moving down the steep part of the Beveridge Curve.
Analysts (Blanchard/Summers) said impossible.
Reality 2023: Waller was right. Vacancies crashed, Unemployment stayed Low. "Immaculate Disinflation."

### 3.2 Hysteresis
Long-term unemployment makes people unemployable (Skills rot, Stigma).
Curve shifts out permanently.
European Labor Markets (High structural unemployment) vs US (Dynamic).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 JOLTS Report
Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.
The key report for the Beveridge Curve.
Quits Rate: Confidence indicator. High Quits = High Wage Growth.
Fed watches JOLTS > NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls) to gauge tightness.

### 4.2 Recruiting Stocks
ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn (Microsoft), Robert Half.
If Beveridge Curve shifts Out (Hard to match), their value proposition goes up?
Or does it mean the market is dysfunctional?
Usually, High Vacancies = Good for Recruiters.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Great Resignation):**
People left the labor force.
Labor Participation Rate dropped.
Employers kept "Ghost Vacancies" open (Hoping for candidates).
V/U ratio hit 2.0 (2 jobs for every unemployed person). Extreme tightness.

**Exercise 2 (Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides):**
Nobel Prize model for Search/Matching.
Frictions matter.
Policy: Retraining programs shift the curve Inward (Efficiency).
Unemployment benefits shift it Outward (Laziness/Selection).
