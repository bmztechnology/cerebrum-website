# Life Settlements Death Bonds

## I. Executive Summary

**Life Settlements** involve purchasing Life Insurance policies from seniors (who no longer need/want them) at a discount to the **Death Benefit**. The investor pays the premiums and collects the payout upon the insured's death. Microstructure relies on **Life Expectancy (LE)** modeling. While morbid, it provides essential liquidity to policyholders and uncorrelated returns to investors.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trade Mechanics)
Face Value: \$1,000,000.
Cash Surrender Value (from Carrier): \$50,000.
Market Offer (Investor): \$200,000.
Senior takes \$200k. Investor takes policy.
Investor IRR depends on *when* the senior dies.
Early death $\implies$ High IRR.
Late death $\implies$ Low IRR (More premiums paid).

### Definition 2.2 (Extension Risk)
Risk that people live longer than model predicts.
Medical breakthroughs (Cure for cancer).
"Longevity Risk."
Negative convexity: The longer they live, the more you pay (Premiums), and the further away the cash flow (TVM).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 STOLI (Stranger-Originated Life Insurance)
Origination fraud.
Paying seniors to take out policies just to sell them immediately.
Lack of "Insurable Interest."
Carriers fight this legally ("Contestability Period").
Valid market requires authentic origination.

### 3.2 Medical Underwriting
2D Underwriting (Age/Gender/Smoker).
3D Underwriting (Medical records, prescriptions, lifestyle).
LE Providers (Fasano, 21st Services) give "Months to Maturity."
Arbitraging the difference between Actuarial Tables and Specific Health Data.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Tertiary Market Trading
Trading portfolios of policies between funds.
Policies are "Seasoned" (Insured is older).
Valuation methodology: Discounted Cash Flow (Probabilistic).
Discount Rate (Yield) usually 10-15%.

### 4.2 Synthetic Life Settlements
Derivatives linked to mortality indices?
Swaps.
"Qx" curves.
Allow hedging longevity risk without holding physical policies.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The AIDS Crisis Mispricing):**
Viatical Settlements (1980s).
Bought from AIDS patients.
Antiretroviral drugs (1996) extended life expectancy by decades.
Investors wiped out.
Technological disruption of biological models.

**Exercise 2 (Premium Optimization):**
"Cost of Insurance" (COI) increases with age.
Shadow Account management.
Paying the *minimum* premium to keep policy in force (Wait for death) vs paying target premium.
Optimization game against the Carrier.
