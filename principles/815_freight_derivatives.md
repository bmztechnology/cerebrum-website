# Freight Derivatives Baltic Dry Index

## I. Executive Summary

**Freight** (Shipping) is the circulatory system of trade. It is non-storable (Service). **Freight Farming Agreements (FFAs)** allow hedging of shipping rates. The **Baltic Dry Index (BDI)** tracks the cost of moving bulk commodities (Iron Ore, Coal). Freight markets are heavily **Cyclical**, driven by the lag between ship ordering (2 years) and immediate demand shocks.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Voyage Charter)
Hiring a ship for Point A to B. Price in \$/ton.
**Time Charter:** Hiring ship for 1 year. Price in \$/day.
**FFA:** Cash settled derivative against the Baltic Index.
Route C5 (Australia to China Iron Ore).

### Definition 2.2 (The Supply Inelasticity)
Supply = Fleet Size.
Takes 2 years to build a Capesize vessel.
Scrapping takes months.
If Demand spikes $\implies$ Rates vertical (2007, 2021).
If Demand drops $\implies$ Rates to OpEx (Fuel/Crew).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 IMO 2020 Scrubber Regulation
Mandate for Low Sulfur Fuel.
Ships had to retrofit "Scrubbers" or burn expensive diesel.
Reduced effective fleet supply (Dry dock time).
Slow Steaming: Slowing down to save fuel reduces effective supply.
Microstructure of environmental compliance.

### 3.2 Leading Indicator
BDI is often cited as a global macro leader.
"No speculation in freight." (You don't book a ship unless you have cargo).
Pure demand signal?
Distortion: Supply side (New deliveries) can mask demand signals.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Iron Ore - Freight Spread
China Steel production requires Iron Ore + Freight.
Landed Cost = Ore Price + Freight.
Arb: Buy Ore FOB (Brazil), Sell Ore CFR (China), Hedge Freight.
Trading the logistics spread.

### 4.2 Tanker Storage Play
Already discussed in Chapter 812.
Tanker rates usually inverse to Oil prices (Contango support).
If Oil crashes $\implies$ Contango $\implies$ Storage Demand $\implies$ Tanker Rates Surge.
Natural hedge for Oil producers?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Ever Given Blockage):**
Suez Canal blocked.
Supply shock.
Container rates spiked.
Sensitivity of global JIT supply chain to choke points.

**Exercise 2 (Container vs Bulk):**
Bulk (BDI) = Raw Materials (Early Cycle).
Container (SCFI) = Finished Goods (Late Cycle).
Divergence signals supply chain bullwhip effects.
