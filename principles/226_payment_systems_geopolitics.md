# Payment Systems Geopolitics: SWIFT vs CIPS

## I. Executive Summary

Financial Messaging Systems are the nervous system of global trade. **SWIFT** (Belgium-based, Western-controlled) is dominant. Adversaries (Russia, China) are building alternatives like **CIPS** (China) and **SPFS** (Russia) to immunize themselves against sanctions. The fragmentation of payment rails creates "Financial Islands" and complicates global settlement.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (SWIFT)
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
Not a bank. A secure WhatsApp for banks.
"Move $10M from Acct A to Acct B."
The actual money moves via Correspondent Banking (Nostro/Vostro).
Cutting SWIFT = Blindness.

### Definition 2.2 (Correspondent Banking)
To pay USD from France to Japan.
French Bank $\to$ US Bank (Correspondent) $\to$ Japanese Bank.
The US Bank MUST be involved for USD clearing.
This gives US "Jurisdiction" over every USD payment globally.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System)
China's alternative.
Can clear Yuan directly continuously.
Often still relies on SWIFT for messaging, but creates a "Direct Clearing" path that bypasses US Correspondent banks.
Goal: Digital Silk Road.

### 3.2 CBDC Bridges (mBridge)
Central Bank Digital Currencies.
Project mBridge (China, UAE, Thailand, HK).
Direct Ledger-to-Ledger atomic swap.
No SWIFT needed. No Dollar needed.
The ultimate technological threat to Dollar Hegemony.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sanction Proofing
If you are Iran/Russia.
You connect banks to CIPS.
You trade in CNY.
You are invisible to OFAC.
The "Shadow Financial System" grows.

### 4.2 ISO 20022
New data standard for payments.
Data-rich.
Allows better compliance/tracking... or better surveillance.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Russia 2022):**
7 Banks banned from SWIFT.
Domestic payments worked fine (SPFS/Mir).
International payments collapsed.
Had to switch to Barter / Cash / Crypto / Yuan.

**Exercise 2 (Crypto Stablecoins):**
USDT (Tether) moves more volume than many banks.
It is a "Private Payment Rail."
Transnational.
Govts hate it (Capital Control evasion). Govts love it (Demand for T-Bills backing it).
