# Investment Grade vs High Yield: The Cliff

## I. Executive Summary

The distinction between **Investment Grade (IG)** (BBB- and above) and **High Yield (HY)** (BB+ and below) is the most critical dividing line in credit markets. It dictates **Investor Base** (Pension funds vs Hedge Funds), **Liquidity**, and **Default Probability**. The crossover points—**Fallen Angels** (Downgrades) and **Rising Stars** (Upgrades)—create massive price dislocations.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Ratings Scale)
-   **IG:** AAA, AA, A, BBB. Default Rate < 0.5% (historically).
-   **HY:** BB, B, CCC, C. Default Rate 2% - 10%.
-   **Distressed:** CCC and below. Pricing assumes default.

### Definition 2.2 (The Regulatory Cliff)
Many mandates (Insurance, Pensions) *forbid* holding HY debt.
If a bond is downgraded from BBB- to BB+ (Fallen Angel):
Forced Selling by IG funds.
Price crashes below fundamental value.
Opportunity for HY funds ("Vultures") to buy cheap.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Duration vs Credit Sensitivity
-   **IG:** High Duration (10Y+). Low Spread (100bps). Returns driven by **Rates** (Treasury moves).
-   **HY:** Low Duration (5Y). High Spread (500bps). Returns driven by **Earnings/Economy** (Equity correlation).
HY has negative correlation to Treasuries (often).

### 3.2 Structural Subordination
HY bonds are often subordinated or unsecured.
IG bonds specific senior unsecured.
Recovery rates differ:
IG Recovery $\approx$ 40-50%.
HY Recovery $\approx$ 20-30% (or lower for subordinated).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Rising Star Trade
Buy BB+ bond that is improving leverage metrics.
Anticipate upgrade to BBB-.
IG funds will be forced to buy.
Spread compression (500bps $\to$ 150bps).
Massive capital gain.

### 4.2 Fallen Angel Knife Catching
Ford/Occidental Petroleum (2020).
Downgraded to Junk.
Prices dropped to 60-70 cents.
Fed intervened (Bought HY ETFs).
Prices rallied to Par.
High risk, high return.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Spread Ratio):**
HY Spread / IG Spread ratio.
Mean reverting?
When ratio is high, HY is cheap.
When ratio is low (tight), HY is expensive (reach for yield).

**Exercise 2 (Refinancing Wall):**
HY companies rely on rolling debt.
If credit markets close (2008, 2020), HY faces liquidity crisis.
IG companies usually have backstop lines of credit.
