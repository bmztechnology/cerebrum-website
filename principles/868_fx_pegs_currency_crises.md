# FX Pegs and Currency Crises

## I. Executive Summary

**FX Pegs** (Fixed Exchange Rates) provide stability for trade but create **Explosive Volatility** when they break. The Microstructure of a **Currency Crisis** involves the Central Bank burning reserves to defend the peg, while speculators (George Soros style) attack it. Sudden devaluations (Turkey, Argentina, Lebanon) wipe out local savings and spike inflation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Impossible Trinity)
A country cannot have all three:
1.  **Fixed Exchange Rate** (Peg).
2.  **Free Capital Flow** (Open borders).
3.  **Independent Monetary Policy** (Set own interest rates).
If you Peg (1) and have Open Capital (2), you *must* follow the US Fed's rates (3).
If you cut rates while US hikes $\implies$ Capital Flight $\implies$ Peg Breaks.

### Definition 2.2 (Hard Peg vs Soft Peg)
**Currency Board (HKD):** Every 1 HKD is backed by 1 USD in reserves. Strong.
**Soft Peg (Argentina):** "We promise it's 1:1." Backed by trust + limited reserves. Weak.
**Dollarization:** Abolish local currency (Ecuador). Zero monetary policy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Speculative Attack
Central Bank has \$10B reserves.
Speculators borrow \$20B local currency, sell it for USD.
Central Bank *must* buy the local currency to maintain the price.
Reserves drain: \$10B $\to$ \$5B $\to$ \$0.
When Reserves = 0, CB stops buying.
Currency free falls (Devaluation).
Speculators buy back local currency for pennies to repay loan.

### 3.2 Interest Rate Defense
To stop the drain, CB hikes rates to 50% (Turkey).
Makes shorting expensive.
But kills the local economy (Mortgages, Business loans).
"Defending the currency at the cost of the economy."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs)
Offshore trading of restricted currencies (CNY, KRW, BRL).
Settled in USD. No physical delivery of Yuan.
Spread between Onshore Spot and Offshore NDF indicates devaluation pressure.
"The Implied Yield."

### 4.2 The Carry Trade Unwind
Long TRY (Turkey) / Short JPY.
Earn 20% yield.
Risk: FX drops 20% in one day.
"Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller."
When the music stops, liquidity vanishes.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Lebanese Haircut):**
Peg broke.
Official Rate: 1500.
Black Market Rate: 100,000.
Banks froze deposits ("Lollars").
If you withdrew USD, you got paid in Lira at 1500 (98% haircut).
Microstructure of a collapsed banking system.

**Exercise 2 (Swiss Franc Shock 2015):**
SNB capped CHF against EUR (1.20).
Defended it for years.
Suddenly abandoned it.
CHF surged 30% in minutes.
FX Brokers (Alpari) went bankrupt (Negative balances).
Pegs break violently.
