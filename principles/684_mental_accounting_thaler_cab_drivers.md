# Mental Accounting Thaler Cab Drivers

## I. Executive Summary

**Mental Accounting** explains why NYC Cab Drivers (Camerer, Babcock, Loewenstein, Thaler, 1997) exhibit **Negative Wage Elasticity**. Rationally, they should drive more on busy days (High wage) and rest on slow days (Low wage). Instead, they set a **Daily Income Target**. On busy days, they hit the target early and quit. On slow days, they grind long hours to hit the target. This inefficient behavior costs them ~15% income.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Income Target Heuristic)
Target = \$200/day.
Busy Day (Rain/Convention): \40/hr. Drive 5 hours. Quit.
Slow Day (Sunny): \$20/hr. Drive 10 hours. Exhaustion.
Rational Strategy: Drive 10 hours on busy days (\$400). Rest on slow days.
Mental Accounting of "Daily PnL" overrides "Lifetime Maximization."

### Definition 2.2 (Paper Losses vs Realized Losses)
Stock is down.
"If I don't sell, I haven't lost."
Mental Account is kept open.
Closing it brings the "Pain of Closing."
Separating money into buckets prevents fungibility.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Bucketing
"House Money" vs "Salary."
"Bonus" vs "Regular Pay."
We spend bonuses on luxury/risk. We spend salary on rent.
Money is fungible, but the mind labels it.

### 3.2 Payment Decoupling
Pre-paying for a vacation.
The "Pain of Paying" is dissociated from the consumption.
Vacation feels "Free."
Credit Cards decouple purchase from payment, encouraging spending.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trader Targets
Daily PnL Goal: \$500.
Hit goal at 10am $\implies$ Stop trading (Good? Avoids giving back?).
Down \$400 at 3pm $\implies$ Revenge trade to hit \$0? (Bad).
Arbitrary temporal brackets (Daily/Monthly) distort decision making.
"The market doesn't know your target."

### 4.2 Dividend Interaction
"Live off the dividends, don't touch principal."
Total Return perspective: Sell 4% of shares = Same thing.
But Mental Accounting treats Principal as Sacred and Dividends as Consumable.
Explains preference for high yield stocks.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Lost Ticket):**
Scenario A: Lost \$20 bill. Buy \$20 ticket? Yes.
Scenario B: Lost the \$20 ticket. Buy another? No.
Mental Account for "Entertainment" is depleted in B, not A.
Economic loss is identical.

**Exercise 2 (Tax Refunds):**
People treat tax refunds as "Found Money" (Windfall).
Splurge.
It is actually an interest-free loan to the government.
Framing matters.
