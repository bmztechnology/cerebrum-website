# Timing Option Investment: The Value of Waiting

## I. Executive Summary

The **Option to Defer** (Timing Option) is the most valuable real option in uncertain environments. Investment opportunities are rarely "Now or Never." They are usually **Perpetual American Call Options**. Exercising/Investing kills the option. Therefore, one should invest only when the NPV is not just positive, but exceeds the **Option Value**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Hurdle Rate)
Standard NPV rule: Invest if $V > I$ (Value > Cost).
Option Value rule: Invest if $V > \beta / (\beta - 1) \times I$.
-   $\beta$: Factor depending on Volatility and Rates. ($\beta > 1$).
The multiplier $\beta / (\beta - 1)$ is the "Option Premium Wedge."
For high volatility, multiplier can be 2.0 or 3.0.
Req: NPV must be 2x or 3x cost to justify killing the wait option.

### Definition 2.2 (Irreversibility)
Investment is a Sunk Cost (Irreversible).
Uncertainty resolves over time.
Waiting allows you to avoid the downside (bad outcome) while keeping the upside (good outcome).
Information has value.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Optimal Stopping Time
Mathematical problem: When to stop waiting and act?
Optimal Boundary $V^*$.
If $V_t < V^*$, Wait.
If $V_t \ge V^*$, Invest.
$V^*$ increases with Volatility. (Higher uncertainty $\implies$ Wait longer).

### 3.2 Opportunity Cost of Waiting
Dividends / Cashflows lost while waiting.
If "Cost of Carry" (lost CF) is high, exercise early.
Analogue to American Call on Dividend paying stock.
Exercise only right before dividend? Or when yield is high enough.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Real Estate Development
Vacant Land = Call Option on a Building.
Should you build now?
Volatility of Rents is high. Construction cost is fixed.
Landowners wait for "Super-Normal" rents before building.
Explains "Gaps" in city skylines (Parking lots in high value zones). Holding out for the skyscraper option.

### 4.2 Tech Adoption
Should a factory upgrade to AI automation?
Tech is improving / Costs dropping (Deflation).
Wait option is valuable.
"Second Mover Advantage."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Competition):**
If the option is Shared (Pre-emptive rights), waiting is dangerous.
Competitor might invest first and steal market share.
"Game Theoretic Real Options."
Competition forces early exercise (erodes Option Value).
Invest early to Block.

**Exercise 2 (Regret):**
Invested at $V=1.1I$. Later $V$ drops to $0.8I$.
Regret.
Should have waited.
The Option Theory quantifies this regret avoidance.
