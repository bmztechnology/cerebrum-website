# Mezzanine Debt Subordination: The Middle Layer

## I. Executive Summary

**Mezzanine Debt** sits between Senior Secured Debt and Equity in the capital structure. It is typically unsecured, subordinated, and carries a higher coupon (10-15%). To enhance returns, it often includes **Equity Kickers** (Warrants) or **PIK** (Payment in Kind) features. It is the fuel for Leverage Buyouts (LBOs).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Heirarchy)
1.  **First Lien:** Bank Loan / Revolver. (L+300). Secured by Assets.
2.  **Second Lien:** Term Loan B. (L+600). Secured by Assets (Second priority).
3.  **Unsecured / Mezzanine:** High Yield Bonds. (fixed 10%). No Collateral.
4.  **Equity:** Residual.

### Definition 2.2 (PIK Toggles)
"Pay If You Can."
Issuer option to pay coupon in cash OR in more bonds (Payment In Kind).
If PIK chosen, Principal increases.
Features protects cashflow during downturns.
Usually requires higher rate if PIK'd (e.g., Cash 10% / PIK 12%).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Structural Subordination (HoldCo vs OpCo)
OpCo (Operating Company) holds assets and generates cash.
HoldCo (Parent) issues Mezzanine Debt.
OpCo debt is structurally senior.
HoldCo relies on dividends from OpCo.
If OpCo defaults, HoldCo gets nothing.

### 3.2 Warrants (Equity Kicker)
Mezz Lender gets 2% Warrants (Option to buy stock at penny price).
Aligns upside.
"Ticket to the dance."
If LBO is home run, Mezz return boosts from 12% to 20% IRR.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Unitranche
Modern Private Credit trend.
Combine Senior + Mezz into one single loan facility (Unitranche).
Rate is blended (e.g., L+700).
Simpler documentation. No "Intercreditor Agreement" wars.

### 4.2 Bridge Loans
Investment Banks lend Mezzanine Bridge to close a deal.
Intended to be refinanced by High Yield Bond issuance in 3 months.
If market shuts (Hung Bridge), Bank is stuck holding toxic debt.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Intercreditor Agreement):**
Standstill clause.
Mezz lenders cannot enforce remedies (bankruptcy) for 180 days after default.
Gives Seniors time to fix the mess.

**Exercise 2 (Recovery Sensitivity):**
Default Scenario. Value = 60% of par.
Senior (50% of cap structure) gets 100% recovery.
Mezz (20% of cap structure) gets...
Remaining value 10% / 20% = 50% recovery.
Mezz recovery is highly sensitive to total leverage "attachment point."
