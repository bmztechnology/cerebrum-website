# Momentum Crash Dynamics

## I. Executive Summary

**Momentum** (buying winners) is a premier anomaly, but it suffers from occasional, catastrophic **Crashes**. A "Momentum Crash" occurs when the market rebounds sharply from a panic; the "Losers" (High Beta junk which Momentum funds are short) rally 50%, while "Winners" (Defensive Low Beta which Momentum funds are long) lag. The result is a massive drawdown for the L/S Momentum factor (e.g., 2009).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Option Like Payoff)
Momentum has negative skewness.
Steady gains (Like selling puts).
Rare massive losses.
Daniel & Moskowitz: "Momentum Crashes."
Occur when market volatility is high and market rebounds.

### Definition 2.2 (The Unit Root Problem)
During a crash, the "Loser" portfolio is effectively a "Short Call Option" on the market.
It has extremely high Beta.
When market rallies, the short side rips.
Momentum strategy effectively "Shorts the Recovery."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Behavioral Over-reaction
Momentum works because investors under-react to news initially, then over-react.
The Crash is the correction of the over-reaction.
When the crowd sudden realizes "The world is not ending," they buy the most beaten-down names (The Momentum Shorts).

### 3.2 Dynamic Hedging
Momentum volatility scales with Market Volatility.
Strategy: Scale down Momentum exposure when VIX is high.
"Managed Momentum."
Avoiding the crash by being out of the casino during turbulence.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Enhanced Momentum
Ranking by "Risk Adjusted" momentum (Sharpe), not just Price Return.
Filter out High Volatility stocks.
Reduces crash risk.

### 4.2 The 2009 Case Study
March-May 2009.
S&P 500 up 40%.
Momentum Factor DOWN 40%.
Why? Momentum was Long Wal-Mart/McDonalds (Safe) and Short Citi/Ford (Bankrupt?).
Reflation rally killed the relative value trade.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Stop Losses on Factors):**
Can you stop out of a factor?
If Momentum DD > 10%, exit.
Whipsaw risk.

**Exercise 2 (Frog in the Pan):**
Stocks that move continuously in small increments (Discrete information) have stronger momentum than stocks that jump (Lumpy information).
Investors notice jumps (Availability) but ignore drift.
