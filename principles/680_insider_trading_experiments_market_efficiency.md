# Insider Trading Experiments

## I. Executive Summary

**Insider Trading** experiments test the **Strong Form Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Do prices reflect private information? Results show that markets are remarkably efficient at aggregating distributed private information ("The Wisdom of Crowds"), but specifically **Insider** information leaks into price slowly, allowing insiders to extract rents before the market converges.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Information Asymmetry)
Insiders know State $S$ (Dividend = High).
Outsiders know $P(S) = 0.5$.
Insiders buy. Price rises.
Outsiders see Price rise. Infer "Insiders must be buying."
Outsiders buy (Momentum).
Price converges to High Dividend value.
Mechanism: **Signal Extraction from Price**.

### Definition 2.2 (The Plott-Sunder Experiment)
Three states (X, Y, Z).
Some traders know "Not X." Others know "Not Y."
Together, they logically know "Z."
The market *finds* price Z efficiently.
The market is smarter than any individual trader.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The No-Trade Theorem
Milgrom & Stokey.
Rational agents should not trade with each other.
If you want to buy, you must know something I don't.
Therefore, I should not sell to you.
Market should freeze.
Reality: Noise Traders (Liquidity Traders) provide the camouflage for Insiders to trade.

### 3.2 Camouflage
Insiders split orders.
"Stealth Trading" (Barclay & Warner).
Using medium-sized trades to avoid detection.
Experiments confirm insiders balance "Greed" (Size) vs "Stealth" (Impact).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Reading the Tape
If Volume is high + Price is flat $\implies$ Absorption (Insider Logic).
If Price moves on no news $\implies$ Informed Trading.
"Someone knows something."
Flow toxicity analysis.

### 4.2 Regulatory Detection
SEC uses "Abnormal Return" metrics.
Lab experiments help calibrate these metrics.
When does "Skill" become statistically impossible without "Inside Info"?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Honey Pot):**
Create a fake asset with *no* information.
See if traders create rumors.
They do.
"Pareidolia" (Seeing faces in clouds) applied to ticker tape.

**Exercise 2 (Whistleblowers):**
Prisoner's Dilemma.
Insider ring.
SEC offers immunity to the first defector.
Game theory dismantles the ring.
