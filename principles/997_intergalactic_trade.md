# Intergalactic Trade Protocols

## I. Executive Summary

**Intergalactic Trade** faces the ultimate barrier: **The Speed of Light (c)**. When communication and transport take years or centuries, traditional market mechanisms fail. This chapter explores **Relativistic Economics**, **Time Dilation Arbitrage**, and the necessity of **Trustless Asynchronous Ledgers** for trade across star systems.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Light Cone Horizon)
Markets are localized to their light cones.
Price information cannot travel faster than $c$.
Arbitrage opportunities exist for millennia but are inaccessible.
The "Efficient Market Hypothesis" applies only locally, not universally.

### Definition 2.2 (Time Dilation Discounting)
For a trader traveling at $0.99c$, only 1 year might pass.
For the bank on Earth, 7 years pass.
Interest rates must account for **Lorentz Transformations**.
$r_{traveler} = r_{stationary} \times \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Asynchronous Ledger
Blockchains across light years.
Consensus latency is limited by distance.
Sharded ledgers where each star system is a shard.
Cross-shard atomicity requires "sub-light locking" mechanisms (very slow).

### 3.2 Relativistic Commodities
What is worth shipping across the stars?
Information (Blueprints, Art, DNA) - Massless.
Antimatter? Exotic Matter?
The cost of transport is near-infinite, so value density must be near-infinite.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long-Duration Trusts
Corporations that outlive civilizations.
Smart contracts executing over thousands of years.
Banking for sleepers (cryogenics).

### 4.2 The Fermi Paradox Economy
Perhaps we don't see trade because it's efficient to be autarkic (see Chapter 999).
Or because they trade in "Computronium" which looks like black heat.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Twin Paradox Hedge):**
Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of a bond if the issuer is moving away at $0.5c$.

**Exercise 2 (Signal Lag):**
You arbitrage a price difference between Alpha Centauri (4.37 ly away) and Sol.
Design the trade execution algorithm knowing your data is 4.37 years old.
