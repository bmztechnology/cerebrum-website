# Black Swan vs Dragon King: Tail Risk Theory

## I. Executive Summary

Risk Models (VaR) assume Normal Distributions. Reality is Fat Tailed. **Black Swans** (Taleb) are unpredictable, high-impact outliers. **Dragon Kings** (Sornette) are extreme events that are *predictable* because they result from the endogenous buildup of instability (Feedback loops) in a complex system. Knowing the difference determines if you hedge (Black Swan) or exit (Dragon King).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Black Swan Attributes)
1.  **Outlier:** Outside regular expectations.
2.  **Extreme Impact:** Changes history.
3.  **Retrospective Predictability:** We explain it afterwards ("It was obvious"), but couldn't predict it ex-ante.
Example: 9/11 Attacks. COVID-19? (Debatable).

### Definition 2.2 (Dragon King Mechanisms)
Systems near "Critical Phase Transitions."
Synchronized behavior.
Log-Periodic Power Laws (LPPL).
Oscillations accelerate before the crash.
Example: 2008 Crash (Housing bubble leverage visible), 1987 Black Monday.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Mediocristan vs Extremistan
-   **Mediocristan:** Height, Weight. Gaussian. Samples average out.
-   **Extremistan:** Wealth, Market Returns. Power Law ($P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha}$). One observation changes the mean.
Standard Risk Mgmt (Sigma) fails in Extremistan.

### 3.2 The Turkey Problem
A turkey is fed for 1000 days.
Confidence in kindness of farmer rises every day $\to$ Max.
Day 1001: Thanksgiving.
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Smooth past performance often implies *hidden accumulating risk*.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Barbell Strategy (Taleb)
90% in Ultra-Safe Assets (T-Bills).
10% in max-risk Speculative Bets / Tail Hedges (Puts).
Avoid the "Middle" (Corporate Bonds, Index Funds) where hidden tail risk destroys you eventually.
"Antifragile": Benefit from chaos.

### 4.2 LPPL Bubble Detection (Sornette)
Fit Log-Periodic Power Law to price curve.
Identify "Singularity" time $t_c$.
Predicts crash window.
Used for Bitcoin tops, 2008 top.
Requires Super-Exponential growth signature.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Long Term Capital Management - LTCM):**
Models said event was "1 in a billion years."
It happened.
Because models assumed uncorrelated markets.
In panic, Correlation = 1.
LTCM was betting against Tail Risk with Leverage. Suicide.

**Exercise 2 (Pandemic Insurance):**
Wimbledon bought Pandemic insurance for years.
Paid off in 2020.
Black Swan hedging is a negative carry trade for years, then makes 100x.
Corporate governance hates negative carry. Rare foresight.
