# Green Building Finance LEED and ESG

## I. Executive Summary

**Green Buildings** (LEED Certified) command a **Green Premium** ("Greenium") in Rents and Sales Prices due to lower operating costs (Energy efficiency) and **Tenant Demand** (Corporate ESG mandates). Conversely, non-compliant "Brown Buildings" face **Stranded Asset Risk** as regulations (e.g., NYC Local Law 97) impose massive fines for carbon emissions.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Greenium)
Spread in Rent/Sale Price between Green and Brown assets.
Evidence: 5-10% Premium on Sale Price.
Why?
1. OpEx Savings (Utilities).
2. Future Proofing (No retrofitting cost).
3. Prestige.

### Definition 2.2 (C-PACE Financing)
Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy.
Loan for green upgrades (Solar, HVAC).
Repaid via Property Tax bill.
Senior to Mortgage.
Transferable on sale.
Microstructure: Long-term, fixed-rate financing attached to the *asset*, not the *owner*.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Discount Rate Adjustment
Green Building Risk $\downarrow$. Marketability $\uparrow$.
Cap Rate should be lower (Higher Price).
Brown Building Risk $\uparrow$ (Obsolescence).
Cap Rate should be higher.
The spread is widening.

### 3.2 Carbon Tax capitalization
If Carbon Tax = \$100/ton.
Building emits 1000 tons.
Tax = \$100k/year.
NOI $\downarrow$ \$100k.
Value $\downarrow$ \$2M (at 5% Cap).
Decarbonization CAPEX of \$1M is rational to save \$2M in value.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 "Brown to Green" Retrofit
Buy inefficient C-Class Office.
Retrofitted windows, HVAC, Sensors.
Achieve LEED Gold.
Re-lease to Tech Tenant at Premium.
Value creation via sustainability.

### 4.2 Green Bonds
REIT issues Green Bond.
Proceeds ring-fenced for green projects.
Yield is slightly lower (Cheaper debt).
Investor demand for ESG product spills over into debt cost advantage.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Net Zero mandates):**
Tenants (Google, Amazon) have Net Zero limits.
They *cannot* lease non-green space.
Demand for Brown Office $\to$ 0.
Stranded Asset.

**Exercise 2 (The Sensor Layer):**
PropTech sensors measuring air quality/energy in real time.
Dynamic BMS (Building Management System).
Data feed $\to$ ESG Score $\to$ Investor Dashboard.
Transparency drives value.
