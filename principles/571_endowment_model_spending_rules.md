# Endowment Model Spending Rules

## I. Executive Summary

University **Endowments** (Yale, Harvard) are perpetual capital pools designed to support the institution forever. They face a **Intergenerational Equity** constraint: Spend enough today to support current students, but save enough to ensure future students have the same purchasing power (Inflation + Growth). They pioneered the **Endowment Model** (High Alts, Illiquidity), but their **Spending Rules** dictate their risk tolerance.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Yale Rule / Hybrid Rule)
$Spend_t = w \times (Spend_{t-1} \times (1 + \pi)) + (1-w) \times (Rate \times AssetValue_t)$.
Weighted average of:
1.  **Inflation-adjusted last year's spend** (Budget Stability).
2.  **Current Market Value** (Market Reality).
Typical $w = 70\%$.
Smoothing mechanism prevents budget volatility during crashes.

### Definition 2.2 (Required Return)
Spend Rate (5%) + Inflation (HEPI 4%) = 9%.
Target Return: 9%.
Bonds yield 4%. Equities yield 7%.
Gap implies need for Alpha / Leverage / Illiquidity Premium.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Perpetual Horizon
Infinite time horizon allows taking "Ultimate Liquidity Risk."
Buying Timberland, Venture Capital.
Lock-up for 20 years is fine if you exist forever.
BUT: Financial Crisis 2008 liquidity crunch (Harvard selling timber at fire-sale prices for cash) challenged this.

### 3.2 Inflation Sensitivity
Universities face HEPI (Higher Education Price Index).
Wage heavy (Tenured professors).
Inflation is the enemy of the endowment.
Real Assets (Real Estate, Commodities) are structural hedges.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Manager Selection
The core comparative advantage.
Access to top VC funds (Sequoia, Benchmark) that are closed to others.
Network effects of the Investment Committee.

### 4.2 Debt Issuance
Universities issuing 100-year bonds.
"Century Bonds."
Lock in low rates. Invest proceeds in Endowment.
Arbitrage: Cost of Debt (3%) vs Expected Return (8%).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Underwater Endowment):**
Market crash. Value drops below "Historic Dollar Value" (corpus).
UPMIFA laws.
Can you spend principal?
Legal constraints on "donor restricted" funds.

**Exercise 2 (The 5% Floor):**
Private Foundations *must* spend 5% by law (IRS).
Endowments don't have this hard floor, but aim for it.
Volatility of the denominator (Assets) makes hitting 5% hard in bear markets.
