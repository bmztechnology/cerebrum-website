# Behavioral Coaching Added Value

## I. Executive Summary

**Behavioral Coaching** is increasingly recognized as the primary source of Advisor Alpha ("Gamma"). Retail investors consistently underperform the funds they own due to **Behavioral Gaps** (Buying high, selling low, chasing performance). The Advisor's role shifts from "Beating the Market" to "Preventing the Client from Beating Themselves."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Behavior Gap)
$Return_{investor} = Return_{investment} - BehaviorCost$.
Morningstar "Mind the Gap" studies show gap is 1-2% per year.
Advisor Value = Closing this gap.
"Vanguard Advisor's Alpha" quantification.

### Definition 2.2 (Biases)
**Loss Aversion:** Pain of loss is 2x pleasure of gain.
**Recency Bias:** Extrapolating recent past into future.
**Confirmation Bias:** Seeking news that validates portfolio.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Policy Base Management
Investment Policy Statement (IPS) signed in calm times.
"Tie yourself to the mast" (Odysseus).
When market crashes, Advisor points to IPS.
"We planned for this."

### 3.2 Reframing
Client: "I lost \$100k!"
Advisor: "Your portfolio is down 5%, which is within our 1-sigma risk band. You are still on track for retirement."
Moving focus from "Price" to "Goals."
Bucketing (Mental Accounting) helps.
