# CBDCs vs Stablecoins

## I. Executive Summary

**Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** are liabilities of the Central Bank (Digital Cash). **Stablecoins** are liabilities of Private Issuers (Digital Deposits). The battle for the future of money is between **Public Monies** (CBDC) and **Private Monies** (Stablecoins). CBDCs offer **Safety** but threaten **Privacy**. Stablecoins offer **Innovation** but carry **Counterparty Risk**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Two-Tier System)
Current System: Fed issues Reserves (to Banks). Banks issue Deposits (to People).
CBDC Model A (Direct): Fed issues Wallets to People. (Disintermediates Banks).
CBDC Model B (Intermediated): Fed issues Digital Token to Banks. Banks manage wallets. (Preserves Status Quo).
Most Western CBDCs favor Model B.

### Definition 2.2 (Programmable Money)
CBDC feature.
"This dollar expires in 30 days" (Stimulus velocity).
"This dollar cannot buy Alcohol."
State control over consumption.
Stablecoins offer programmability via Smart Contracts (DeFi), unrestricted by State logic (mostly).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Privacy Paradox
Cash is anonymous.
Digital payments are tracked.
CBDC could be "Total Surveillance" (Panopticon).
Crypto (Zero Knowledge Proofs) offers "Digital Cash" (Privacy).
The Regulatory war on Privacy "Mixers" (Tornado Cash).

### 3.2 The Eurodollar 2.0
Stablecoins extend US Dollar hegemony globally.
Citizens in hyperinflation (Turkey, Argentina) use USDT, not CBDC.
US Gov effectively outsourcing "Dollarization" to Tether/Circle?
Strategic advantage.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Wholesale CBDC
Settlement between Banks.
Atomic Settlement (DvP).
Replaces SWIFT/FedWire.
Efficiency gain is massive (T+0 settlement vs T+2).
Uncontroversial.

### 4.2 Retail CBDC
"FedNow" (Fast payments) vs CBDC (Bearer asset).
If FedNow is instant, do we need CBDC?
Debate.
CBDC is about "Tokenization" (Integration with smart contracts), not just speed.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Bank Run):**
If CBDC exists (Safe), and Crisis hits.
Everyone moves Deposits (Risky) to CBDC (Safe) instantly.
Commercial Banks collapse.
CBDC increases systemic fragility of private banking?

**Exercise 2 (Sanctions):**
US freezes Russia's reserves.
Weaponization of the dollar.
Accelerates demand for "Neutral Reserves" (Gold, Bitcoin).
CBDC is the ultimate sanction tool (Freeze individual wallet).
