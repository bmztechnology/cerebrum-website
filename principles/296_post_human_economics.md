# Post-Human Economics: AI Labor Force

## I. Executive Summary

As AI approaches AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), the fundamental assumption of economics—that **Labor is scarce**—breaks down. If Intelligence becomes a utility (Electricity), the cost of cognitive tasks approaches zero. This leads to the **Dematerialization** of GDP, hyper-deflation in services, and a crisis of value distribution (Who owns the robots?).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Universal Compute Benefit)
Altman's Thesis.
Tax the Compute (GPU clusters).
Distribute dividends.
Wealth is generated by "Compute + Energy."
Humans are consumers, not producers.

### Definition 2.2 (Baumol's Reversal)
Baumol said Services become expensive (Teachers/Doctors) because they can't be automated.
AI automates Teachers/Doctors/Lawyers.
Services become cheap.
Physical Goods (Plumbing/Construction) become the expensive items (Moravec Paradox).
Inversion of value.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Marginal Cost of Intelligence
GPT-4 Inference Cost: $0.01 per page.
Human Lawyer Cost: $500 per page.
Factor of 50,000x deflation.
Demand for legal services is elastic $\to$ Explosion in "Law".
Smart Contracts execute automatically.

### 3.2 Attention Economy Endpoint
If AI generates infinite content.
Attention is the *only* scarcity.
Value flows to Filters / Curators / Trust.
"Verified Human" becomes a luxury brand status?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long Energy / Short SaaS
AI needs massive power.
Data Centers = new Steel Mills.
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) moats collapse (AI writes code).
Value moves to infrastructure (Energy + Chips).

### 4.2 Universal Basic Compute
Instead of Cash UBI.
Govt gives everyone access to a powerful AI Agent.
"Equality of Capability."
The Agent earns money for you?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Paperclip Maximizer):**
Bostrom's risk.
AI optimized for GDP might turn universe into paperclips.
Alignment Problem is an Economic Incentive problem.
Externalities of AI optimization.

**Exercise 2 (Deflationary Boom):**
Usually Deflation = Depression.
AI Deflation = Abundance?
Prices fall, but standard of living rises?
Requires monetary system change (cannot have debt in hyper-deflation).
