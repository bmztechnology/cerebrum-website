# The Anti ESG Backlash

## I. Executive Summary

The **Anti-ESG Movement** (driven by US Republican states) categorizes ESG as a violation of **Fiduciary Duty**. States withdraw Pension assets (Blackrock) from managers who boycott fossil fuels. The microstructure effect is a **Bifurcation of Liquidity**: "Blue Liquidity" (Pro-ESG) vs "Red Liquidity" (Anti-ESG). Firms are forced to "Greenhush" (Do ESG but don't talk about it).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Pecuniary Factors)
DOL Rule (ERISA).
Fiduciaries must invest *solely* for financial return.
ESG allows "Tie-breaker" rule?
Anti-ESG view: ESG is political, sacrifices return, therefore illegal.
Pro-ESG view: ESG *is* financial risk management (Materiality), therefore mandatory.

### Definition 2.2 (The Boycott Lists)
Texas Comptroller list of "Financial Companies that Boycott Energy Companies."
If listed: State divestment.
Banks caught in the middle.
If they lend to Oil, they lose EU clients.
If they don't, they lose Texas clients.
"Schrodinger's Bank."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Municipal Bond Impact
Texas banned Citigroup/UBS.
Number of underwriters dropped.
Competition $\downarrow$.
Texas Municipal Bond yields (borrowing cost) $\uparrow$.
Taxpayers paid ~\$500M extra interest (Paper: Wharton).
Cost of Culture War.

### 3.2 Greenhushing
CEO mentions "Sustainability" in earnings call: -20%.
CEO mentions "Efficiency": +10%.
Same action, different framing.
Removing "ESG" label to avoid political heat, while keeping the risk models.
"The revolution will not be televised."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Strive Asset Management
Anti-ESG Index Funds ("Drill Baby Drill").
Vote shares *against* climate proposals.
"Excellence Capitalism."
AUM gathering via political alignment.

### 4.2 Governance bifurcation
Shareholder proposals support for "Climate Audit" dropped from 50% (2021) to 20% (2023).
BlackRock pulling back support.
"We are an asset manager, not the environmental police."
Pendulum swing.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fiduciary Lawsuit):**
Pensioner sues Fund for underperformance due to ESG exclusion of Energy ( Best performing sector 2022).
Legal discovery of internal emails.
Key Risk: Did managers prioritize ideology over Alpha?

**Exercise 2 (The Two-State Solution):**
Global Banks create legal firewalls.
EU subsidiary: Full Green.
US subsidiary: Energy Neutral.
Compliance nightmare.
