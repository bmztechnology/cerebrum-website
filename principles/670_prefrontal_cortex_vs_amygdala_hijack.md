# Prefrontal Cortex vs Amygdala Hijack

## I. Executive Summary

The battle for financial rationality is fought between two brain regions: the **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** (Logic, Planning, Impulse Control) and the **Amygdala** (Fear, Urgency, Survival). An **Amygdala Hijack** (Goleman) occurs when the Amygdala overrides the PFC during sudden market shocks, causing **Panic Selling** or **Impulsive Buying** before logic can intervene.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Low Road vs High Road)
LeDoux.
**Low Road:** Eyes $\to$ Thalamus $\to$ Amygdala. (Fast, Dirty, Emotional). Speed: 12ms.
**High Road:** Eyes $\to$ Thalamus $\to$ Cortex $\to$ Amygdala. (Slow, Detailed, Rational). Speed: 25ms.
In a crash, the Low Road triggers the "Sell" click before the High Road understands *why*.

### Definition 2.2 (Executive Function)
PFC tasks: Future planning, Probability estimation, Inhibition of impulses.
Trading Plan resides in the PFC.
Execution failures happen when Stress disconnects the PFC.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Emotional regulation
The PFC "down-regulates" the Amygdala.
"Calm down, it's just a pullback, not a crash."
Training (Experience) strengthens this connection.
Novices have weak regulation $\implies$ High volatility in behavior.

### 3.2 Decision Fatigue
PFC consumes massive glucose.
It tires easily (after 4 hours of intense focus).
"Afternoon slump" $\implies$ Weakened PFC $\implies$ Amygdala takes over.
Most discipline breaches happen late in the session.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Checklist Discipline
Checklists are external PFCs.
They force a logical sequence.
"Did I check the weekly chart?" "Is volatility within range?"
Using a physical paper checklist prevents the "Low Road" reflex.

### 4.2 The 10-Second Rule
Delay reaction by 10 seconds.
Allows the "High Road" signal to reach the Amygdala.
"Count to ten before you click."
Simple neuro-hack.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Identify the Hijack):**
Symptoms: Tunnel vision, Racing heart, "I MUST act now."
Label it: "This is a hijack."
Naming the emotion engages the PFC (Right Ventrolateral PFC).

**Exercise 2 (Glucose Loading):**
Sipping juice/glucose during high stress?
Baumeister's Willpower theory.
Controversial, but ensuring brain is fueled prevents fatigue.
