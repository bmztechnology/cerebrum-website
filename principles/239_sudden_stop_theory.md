# Sudden Stop Theory: When the Music Stops

## I. Executive Summary

A **Sudden Stop** (Calvo) is an abrupt reduction in net capital flows into an Emerging Market. It is not a gradual slowdown; it is a violent reversal ($\Delta Flows > 5\%$ GDP). It typically triggers a "Triple Crisis": Currency Crash, Banking Crisis, and Sovereign Default. The trigger is often external (Fed Hiking), not internal.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Balance of Payments Constraint)
$$CA + KA = 0$$
-   Current Account ($CA$) = Trade Balance.
-   Capital Account ($KA$) = Foreign Investment.
If country runs a $CA$ Deficit (Imports > Exports), it needs $KA$ Surplus (Inflows).
If **Sudden Stop** occurs ($KA \to 0$), then $CA$ must instantly adjust to 0.
How? Imports must collapse. Consumption must collapse.
This is a "Compressed Recession."

### Definition 2.2 (Liability Dollarization)
Amplifier.
Sudden Stop $\to$ Currency Crash.
If Liabilities are Dollarized $\to$ Balance Sheet Recessions.
Banks stop lending.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Push vs Pull Factors
-   **Pull (Internal):** High Growth, Reform, Stability (Attracts capital).
-   **Push (External):** Low US Rates (Chases yield).
Empirical Evidence: **Push Factors** dominate. EMs are an asset class correlated to US Liquidity.
"When the Fed sneezes, EM catches a cold."

### 3.2 3rd Generation Crisis Models
Focus on Balance Sheet constraints.
Liquidity mismatch (Short term debt, Long term assets).
Similar to a Bank Run, but on a Country.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Fed Cycle Timing
Sell EM Assets 6 months *before* the first Fed Hike.
Capital creates the "Sudden Stop" preemptively.
Taper Tantrum (2013) was a classic Sudden Stop caused by *talk* of hiking.

### 4.2 Reserve Adequacy
Countries with massive Reserves (China, Saudi) are immune to Sudden Stops.
They can fund the $KA$ gap using their own savings.
Vulnerable: Turkey, South Africa (Low Reserves + High Deficits).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Turkey 2018):**
Sudden Stop.
Lira crashed 40%.
Interest Rates hiked to 24% to stop the bleeding.
Imports collapsed. CA moved from Deficit to Surplus overnight.
Painful but arithmetic integrity restored.

**Exercise 2 (The IMF Role):**
IMF acts as the "Capital Account of Last Resort."
Replaces private outflows with official inflows.
