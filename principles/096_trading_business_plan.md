Successful trading is not a hobby; it is a business operation requiring a formal plan. This document aggregates all prior 98 chapters into an operational manual.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Drafting):**
Write your plan. Now.
If you cannot define your "Trigger" in one sentence, you do not have one.

**Exercise 2 (The "If-Then" Matrix):**
Create a flowsheet.
IF Trend Up AND Pullback AND Signal $\to$ BUY.
IF Trend Up AND Pullback BUT No Signal $\to$ WAIT.
IF Trend Up BUT News Event $\to$ CANCEL.

**Exercise 3 (Audit):**
Give your plan to a non-trader.
Can they execute it?
If not, it is too subjective. "Buy when it looks good" is not a plan.
