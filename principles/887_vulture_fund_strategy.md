# Vulture Fund Strategy Elliott and Paul Singer

## I. Executive Summary

**Vulture Funds** (Distressed Activists) buy debt of failing companies (or Sovereigns) at deep discounts with the intent to **Litigate** or **Control**. Unlike passive distressed investors, Vultures actively **Block Plans**, **Seize Assets**, and **Enforce Rights**. The strategy is **Event-Driven** and relies on **Process Alpha** (Knowing the legal rules better than the opponent).

Elliott vs Argentina.
15-year battle.
Found a clause that said "Sovereign will treat bonds equally."
