# Twin Shares Anomaly Royal Dutch Shell

## I. Executive Summary

The **Twin Shares Anomaly** involves two companies (or distinct shares of one entity) with identical claims on cash flows trading at different prices. The most famous case is **Royal Dutch Shell** (Royal Dutch traded at a premium to Shell Transport relative to their 60:40 contractual split). This violation of the **Law of One Price** demonstrates that markets are segmented and arbitrage is limited by friction and noise.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Siamese Twin)
Company A and B merge operations but keep separate listings.
Contract: Cash flows split X% / Y%.
$Theoretical Ratio = P_A / P_B = X / Y$.
$Actual Ratio$ deviates significantly and persistently.
Other examples: Unilever NV vs PLC, Rio Tinto.

### Definition 2.2 (Market Segmentation)
Royal Dutch (S&P 500 member) vs Shell (FTSE 100 member).
Index funds *must* buy the local share.
Demand is Index-Dependent, not Value-Dependent.
Location of listing matters more than cash flow rights.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Limits to Arbitrage (Again)
Long Ticker A, Short Ticker B.
Spread should converge.
History: LTCM (Long Term Capital Management) bet heavily on this spread closing.
It widened.
LTCM blew up.
"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."

### 3.2 Noise Trader Risk
De Long, Shleifer, Summers, Waldmann (DSSW).
Arbitrageurs face the risk that mispricing worsens in the short run.
Finite horizon prevents correcting the infinite horizon price.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Dual Class Share Arbitrage
Google GOOG vs GOOGL.
Voting vs Non-Voting.
Premium for vote?
Usually small (1-2%).
If widens to 10%, arb opportunity?
Unless Zuckerberg/Brin control > 50% anyway, making votes worthless.

### 4.2 ADRs vs Locals
Alibaba (BABA) NY vs 9988 HK.
Fungible?
Yes, but conversion takes days + fees.
Intraday gaps appear.
HFT arbs this away instantly (unlike Twin Shares which were distinct legal entities).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tax Credits):**
Dividend Withholding Tax differences.
Royal Dutch (Netherlands) vs Shell (UK).
Different tax treaties.
Price difference might be rational for tax-exempt vs taxable investors.

**Exercise 2 (The Convergence Event):**
Unification.
When Shell finally merged shares in 2005.
Spread collapsed to zero instantly.
Event-Driven funds profited.
