# The Impossible Trinity Revisited: The Trilemma

## I. Executive Summary

The **Impossible Trinity** (Mundell-Fleming Trilemma) is the fundamental law of International Macroeconomics. A country can choose only **two** of the following three:
1.  **Free Capital Mobility** (Open Borders).
2.  **Fixed Exchange Rate** (Stability).
3.  **Independent Monetary Policy** (Sovereignty).
Attempting to have all three leads to inevitable crisis. Every financial crisis in history can be explained by a violation of this rule.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Three Corners)
-   **Side A (USA/Eurozone):** Open Capital + Independent Policy $\implies$ **Floating Rate**. (Volatility is the price of freedom).
-   **Side B (Hong Kong):** Open Capital + Fixed Rate $\implies$ **Imported Policy**. (must follow Fed).
-   **Side C (China):** Fixed Rate + Independent Policy $\implies$ **Capital Controls**. (Must Build a Wall).

### Definition 2.2 (The Mechanism of Failure)
Trying A+B+C:
Fix Rate (Peg). Cut Rates (Stimulus). Allow Capital Outflow.
Investors borrow cheap currency, convert to foreign currency (breaking Peg).
Central Bank sells reserves to defend Peg.
Reserves = 0. Peg Breaks.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Dilemma? (Rey)
Helen Rey argues it's actually a "Dilemma," not a Trilemma.
Even with Floating Rates, Global Financial Cycles (Fed Policy) dictate domestic conditions.
"Open Capital Markets + Independent Policy" is an illusion.
True choice: Capital Controls or Submission to the Fed.

### 3.2 Bretton Woods
System was Side C (Fixed Rate + Independent Policy).
Solved by strict Capital Controls (1945-1971).
Globalization removed controls, forcing the world to Side A.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Crisis Prediction
Look for the country trying to cheat.
Turkey (2020-2023): Wanted Low Rates + Stable Lira + Semi-Open Capital.
Result: Lira collapsed 90%.
You cannot cheat the Trilemma.

### 4.2 Emerging Market Carry
EMs usually want Stability (Peg) to attract capital.
But need Independence to fight local inflation.
They oscillate.
Trade: Long Volatility when an EM Central Bank claims they can "Manage" the rate while diverging from the Fed.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Eurozone):**
Member states (Greece) gave up Independent Policy (ECB) and Exchange Rate (Euro).
Gained: Capital Mobility.
Result: Greece could not devalue or print money in 2011. Had to default internally (Austerity).

**Exercise 2 (Switzerland):**
Wanted Independent Policy (Negative Rates).
Wanted Stable Rate (Cap CHF).
Capital was Open.
Impossible.
Capital inflow swamped them.
Chose Independence (Drop Peg).
