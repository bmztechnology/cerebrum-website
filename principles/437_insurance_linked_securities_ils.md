# Insurance Linked Securities ILS: Life & Cat

## I. Executive Summary

**ILS** transfer insurance risks to capital markets. **Catastrophe Bonds** (Cat) cover property/casualty (Hurricane, Quake). **Life Settlements** (and Mortality Bonds) cover longevity/mortality risk. These assets offer **Non-Correlated Returns** (Beta Zero) relative to stocks/bonds, making them highly prized for diversification, despite their "Binary" payoff nature (Principal or Zero).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cat Bond Pricing)
Spread = Expected Loss (EL) $\times$ Multiple.
Multiple typically 2.0x to 4.0x.
Compensates for "Model Risk" (RMS/AIR models might be wrong) and "Capital Cost" (Tieing up capital in SPV).

### Definition 2.2 (Life Settlements)
Buying Life Insurance policies from seniors (who surrender).
Pay premiums. Collect Death Benefit.
Return depends on **Longevity**.
Risk: "Extension Risk" (People live longer than expected). Medical breakthroughs.
Ethical "Death Bond" stigma.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Embedded Options
ILS are Short Put Options.
Investor writes insurance.
Premium income is the option premium.
Trigger event is the Strike.

### 3.2 Sidecars / Reinsurance
Hedge Funds (Nephila) set up "Sidecars."
Quota Share with Reinsurer (Swiss Re).
Take 20% of premiums and 20% of losses.
Direct access to reinsurance pricing without the SPV friction.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Diversification
2008 Financial Crisis: ILS positive performance.
2022 Inflation/Rate Hike: ILS positive (Floating rate collateral).
Only correlation is "Liquidity" (Investors selling ILS to cover margin calls elsewhere).

### 4.2 Climate Change
Pricing in "Climate Beta."
Florida Wind premiums doubling.
Models adjusting frequency of Cat 5 storms.
Is the market pricing it correctly? Or is it a "subsidy" providing cheap insurance to coastal homes?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Basis Risk):**
Parametric Trigger (Wind Speed at Station A).
Losses occurred at Station B (20 miles away).
Insurer has losses, Bond doesn't trigger.
Basis Risk for the Hedger (Insurer). Good for Investor.

**Exercise 2 (Trapped Capital):**
Event occurs (Hurricane). Losses estimation takes time (3 years).
Collateral in SPV is "Trapped" (Cannot be returned to investor) until finalized.
"Dead Capital."
