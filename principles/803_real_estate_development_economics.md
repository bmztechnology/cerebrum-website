# Real Estate Development Economics

## I. Executive Summary

**Development** is the manufacturing arm of Real Estate. It involves the highest risk (Entitlement, Construction, Market) and highest potential return (Developer Promote). Microstructure focuses on the **Draw Schedule** (Cash outflows), the **J-Curve** of equity value, and the **Waterfall** distribution of profits between the General Partner (GP) and Limited Partners (LP).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Development Pro Forma)
$$ Profit = Value_{Completed} - Cost_{Total} $$
**Value:** NOI / Exit Cap Rate.
**Cost:** Hard Costs (Bricks) + Soft Costs (Architects) + Land + Financing ($Interest_{Reserve}$).
**Yield on Cost (YOC):** $NOI / Cost$.
Rule of Thumb: $YOC > Exit Cap + 150bps$ (Development Spread).

### Definition 2.2 (The Promote)
GP puts up 10% of equity. LP puts up 90%.
Pari Passu return until 8% IRR (Preferred Return).
Tier 2 (8-15% IRR): 80/20 split.
Tier 3 (15%+ IRR): 50/50 split (The "Promote").
Incentivizes GP to outperform.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The J-Curve
Time 0: Buy Land. Equity Value = Cost.
Time 1: Entitlement. Equity Value $\uparrow$ (De-risking).
Time 2: Construction Start. Cash Drain. Risk $\uparrow$. Value $\flat$.
Time 3: Lease Up. Value $\uparrow \uparrow$. (Stabilization).
Time 4: Sale. Realize Profit.
The "J" shape of cumulative cash flow. Deep negative before rapid positive.

### 3.2 Real Options in Land
Land is a Call Option on Development.
Strike Price = Construction Cost.
Underlying = Completed Building Value.
Expiration = Zoning Expiry.
Volatility = Market Price Volatility.
Developers are Option Holders. They wait for "in the money" conditions (High Prices) to exercise (Build).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Entitlement Arbitrage
Buy un-zoned land (cheap).
Spend 2 years getting zoning approval (Political capital).
Sell zoned land to builder.
No construction risk. Pure "Paper" value creation.
High Alpha strategy.

### 4.2 Construction Loan Hedging
Floating rate debt (SOFR + 3%).
Interest Rate Cap required by Lender.
If rates spike (2023), Cap pays out.
Without Cap, project goes underwater $\to$ "Broken Deal."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Material Cost Inflation):**
Lumber prices +300% (2021).
Hard Costs explode.
Developer Margin vanishes.
GMP Contract (Guaranteed Maximum Price) protects Developer, hurts Contractor.
Cost Plus Contract hurts Developer.

**Exercise 2 (The Refi Exit):**
Build for \$10M. Value \$15M.
Get Perm Loan at 70% LTV (\$10.5M).
Pay off Construction Loan (\$7M) + Equity (\$3M).
Cash Out \$0.5M.
Keep the building. Infinite ROI.
"The BRRRR Strategy" (Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat).
