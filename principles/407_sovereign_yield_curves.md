# Sovereign Yield Curves: Risk Free Benchmark

## I. Executive Summary

**Sovereign Yield Curves** (US Treasury, German Bund, JGB) serve as the fundamental benchmark for all financial assets. They are theoretically "Risk Free" (in nominal terms) due to the state's taxing and money-printing power. The curve reflects pure **Time Value of Money**, **Inflation Expectations**, and **Monetary Policy** stance. Deviations (Spreads) between sovereigns (e.g., BTP-Bund spread) measure **Sovereign Credit Risk**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Benchmark Tenors)
2Y: Monetary Policy proxy.
10Y: Growth/Inflation proxy. Benchmark for Mortgages.
30Y: Liability matching (Pension funds).
"On-the-Run": Most recently issued (Liquid).
"Off-the-Run": Older issues (Less liquid, trade at discount).

### Definition 2.2 (Flight to Quality)
Crisis Event $\implies$ Sell Stocks / Buy Treasuries.
Yields Fall. Prices Rise.
Negative Beta to Equities.
The foundation of the 60/40 Portfolio.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Term Premium
Yield = Expected Average Short Rate + Term Premium.
Term Premium compensates for Duration Risk and uncertainty.
Can be negative (Greenspan's Conundrum).

### 3.2 Quantitative Easing (QE)
Central Bank buys Long Terms bonds.
"Taking Duration out of the market."
Depresses Term Premium. Flattens curve.
Forces investors into riskier assets (Portfolio Rebalance Channel).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Cross-Country Spreads
Italy (BTP) vs Germany (Bund).
Both in Euro. No FX risk.
Spread is pure Default Risk / Denomination Risk (Euro breakup).
"The Spread" is the barometer of Eurozone crisis.

### 4.2 Dollar Dominance
UST Curve drives global borrowing costs.
Emerging Markets borrow in USD.
If UST yields rise, EM funding stress increases.
"The Fed is the World's Central Bank."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Breakeven Inflation):**
Nominal Yield - Real Yield (TIPS).
10Y Nominal 4%. 10Y TIPS 1.5%.
Breakeven = 2.5%.
Market expects 2.5% inflation over 10 years.

**Exercise 2 (Negative Yields):**
German Bunds 2018. Yield -0.5%.
Guaranteed loss if held to maturity.
Why buy?
1. Regulation (Banks must hold HQLA).
2. Deflation bet (Yields go to -1.0%, Price rises).
3. FX Hedge (Euro strengthens > 0.5%).
