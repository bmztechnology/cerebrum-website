# Commodity Channel Index: Cyclical Analysis

## I. Introduction

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI), developed by Donald Lambert in 1980, measures current price relative to an average price level over a given period. Despite its name, it works on any tradable instrument.

## II. Mathematical Construction

### Definition 2.1 (Typical Price)
$$TP_t = \frac{H_t + L_t + C_t}{3}$$

### Definition 2.2 (Simple Moving Average of TP)
$$SMA_{TP} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} TP_{t-i}$$

### Definition 2.3 (Mean Deviation)
$$MD = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |TP_{t-i} - SMA_{TP}|$$

### Definition 2.4 (CCI)
$$CCI = \frac{TP - SMA_{TP}}{0.015 \times MD}$$

### 2.5 Lambert's Constant (0.015)
This constant ensures ~70-80% of CCI values fall within [-100, +100]:
$$0.015 = \frac{1}{66.67}$$

Approximately 1/66.67 of average deviation.

## III. Statistical Properties

### Theorem 3.1 (Unbounded Range)
Unlike RSI or Stochastic, CCI has no theoretical bounds:
$$CCI \in (-\infty, +\infty)$$

### Proposition 3.2 (Standard Interpretation)
| CCI Value | Condition |
|-----------|-----------|
| > +100 | Strong uptrend / Overbought |
| +100 to -100 | Normal range |
| < -100 | Strong downtrend / Oversold |

### Theorem 3.3 (Zero Line)
$$CCI = 0 \iff TP = SMA_{TP}$$

Price at average → CCI at zero.

## IV. Signal Generation

### 4.1 Zero Line Crossover
**Bullish:** CCI crosses above 0
**Bearish:** CCI crosses below 0

### 4.2 Overbought/Oversold
**Buy signal:** CCI rises from below -100 to above -100
**Sell signal:** CCI falls from above +100 to below +100

### 4.3 Divergence
**Bullish divergence:** Price lower low, CCI higher low
**Bearish divergence:** Price higher high, CCI lower high

### 4.4 Trend Confirmation
Strong trend: CCI consistently above/below zero
$$\forall t \in [window]: CCI_t > 0 \Rightarrow Strong\ Uptrend$$

## V. Trading Strategies

### 5.1 Breakout Strategy
Buy when CCI > +100 (momentum breakout)
Sell when CCI < -100 (momentum breakdown)

### 5.2 Mean Reversion
Sell when CCI > +200 (extreme overbought)
Buy when CCI < -200 (extreme oversold)

### 5.3 Dual Timeframe
- Higher TF: Trend direction (CCI > 0 = bullish)
- Lower TF: Entry timing (CCI oversold = buy in uptrend)

## VI. Comparison with Other Oscillators

| Feature | CCI | RSI | Stochastic |
|---------|-----|-----|------------|
| Input | HLC | Close | HLC |
| Bounded | No | Yes [0,100] | Yes [0,100] |
| Faster | Yes | No | Yes |
| Mean Deviation | Yes | No | No |

## VII. Advanced Applications

### 7.1 CCI Divergence Success Rate
Studies show divergence + trend alignment improves accuracy:
$$P(Reversal | Divergence \land Trend_{aligned}) > 0.6$$

### 7.2 Multiple CCI
Using two CCI periods:
- CCI(14): Short-term momentum
- CCI(50): Medium-term trend

## VIII. Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Calculate CCI(5) for:
TP = [100, 102, 101, 103, 104]

**Exercise 2:** Why does Lambert use Mean Deviation instead of Standard Deviation?

**Exercise 3:** If CCI = +150 and SMA_TP = 100, what is the Typical Price?

**Exercise 4:** Design a strategy combining CCI with trend filter.
