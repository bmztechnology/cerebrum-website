# Collective Action Clauses CAC: Majority Rule

## I. Executive Summary

**Collective Action Clauses (CACs)** are contractual provisions designed to neutralize Holdout Creditors. They allow a **Supermajority** (typically 75%) of bondholders to agree to a restructuring that becomes **Binding** on the dissenting minority (Cramdown). Modern "Aggregated CACs" (Single Limb) allow voting across *all* bond series simultaneously, preventing holdouts from blocking specific small bond issues.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Voting Thresholds)
-   **Old English Law:** Required 100% for payment terms change. (Unanimous).
-   **Standard CAC:** 75% of Principal Outstanding.
-   **Euro Area CAC:** Included in all bonds since 2013 (ESM Treaty).

### Definition 2.2 (Aggregation)
-   **Series-by-Series:** Blocking position needed in *each* bond (25% + 1 bond).
-   **Single Limb:** 75% of *Total* Debt votes. No series-level vote.
Makes holding out impossible unless you own >25% of the *entire* national debt.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Pricing Impact
Do CACs increase borrowing costs? (Moral Hazard: Easier to default).
Empirical evidence: No significant yield premium for CACs in IG/BB.
For CCC, slight premium.
Investors prefer "Orderly Restructuring" over "Chaotic Litigation."

### 3.2 The Anti-Deprivation Principle
Bankruptcy law principle.
You cannot design a contract that strips value upon insolvency?
CACs are consistent with Chapter 11 logic applied to Sovereigns.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Ecuador 2020
First major use of Aggregated CACs.
Rapid restructuring during COVID.
98% participation.
Holdouts crushed.

### 4.2 Restructuring Design
Assigning "Voting Power."
Exchange ratios designed to incentivize early voting ("Consent Fee").
"Exit Consents": Vote to strip the old bond of all protections (Cross-default, waiver of immunity) as you leave. Leaving the holdout with a worthless shell.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Blocking Stake):**
Fund buys 26% of a small illiquid bond series.
Under "Series-by-Series" CAC, they can block that specific bond.
Demand full payout to release the hostage.
Single Limb kills this strategy.

**Exercise 2 (Governing Law):**
Local Law bonds don't need CACs.
Sovereign change the law (Congress passes "Restructuring Act").
CACs only matter for NY/English/foreign law bonds.
