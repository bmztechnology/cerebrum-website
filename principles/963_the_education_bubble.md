# The Education Bubble

## I. Executive Summary

**Higher Education** costs have risen 4x faster than inflation. The **Return on Investment (ROI)** of a degree is declining (Credential Inflation). The synthesis argues that Universities are **Veblen Goods** (Status signaling) rather than **Human Capital Factories**. The Bubble bursts when **Alternative Credentialing** (Google Certificates, AI Tutors) breaks the monopoly on signaling.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Signaling Theory - Spence)
Degree doesn't teach skills.
It proves you have IQ and Conscientiousness (can sit still for 4 years).
Value is in the *Filter*, not the Content.
If AI can filter talent cheaper (Skill-based assessment), the Degree becomes worthless.

### Definition 2.2 (Baumol's Cost Disease)
Services that require humans (Teaching, Quartet playing) don't get productivity gains.
Manufacturing gets cheaper (Robots).
Relative cost of services explodes.
Universities act like Luxury Resorts (Lazy Rivers) to attract students.
Administrative bloat.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Student Loan Securitization (SLABS)
Student Loans Asset-Backed Securities.
Govt guarantees the loans.
Universities raise tuition because "Credit is available."
Feedback loop.
Total Debt > \$1.7 Trillion.
Forgiveness = Moral Hazard? Or Bailout of a Predatory System?

### 3.2 The Unbundling of the University
Bundle: Education + Social Network + Credential + Daycare.
Unbundled:
Education $\to$ Coursera/YouTube (Free).
Network $\to$ Y Combinator / Discord.
Credential $\to$ Portfolio/Github.
Daycare $\to$ ?
Disruption is messy.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Income Share Agreements (ISAs)
School pays tuition.
Student pays % of future income for 5 years.
Equity financing instead of Debt.
Aligns incentives.
If student gets no job, School loses money.
School closes bad majors (Philosophy?).

### 4.2 EdTech Alpha
Long Duolingo (Gamification).
Short 2nd Tier Private Colleges (Bankruptcy risk).
Harvard/Stanford are safe (Luxury brands).
The middle gets crushed.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The AI Tutor):**
Khan Academy + GPT-4.
Personalized 1-on-1 tutoring for free.
Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem solved?
Democratization of elite education.

**Exercise 2 (Grade Inflation):**
A is the most common grade.
Signal noise.
Employers stop trusting GPA.
Shift to LeetCode tests / Internships.
