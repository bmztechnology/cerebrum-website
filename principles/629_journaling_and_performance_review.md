# Journaling and Performance Review

## I. Executive Summary

**Journaling** is the primary tool for self-improvement in trading. It converts random market experience into structured **Wisdom**. A robust journal records not just Entry/Exit prices, but **Emotional State**, **Rationale**, and **Mistakes**. The **Performance Review** (Weekly/Monthly) identifies recurring behavioral patterns (e.g., "I always lose money on Fridays").

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Emotional Tag)
Metadata attached to every trade.
Tags: "Impulse", "Revenge", "Boredom", "Planned".
Analytics: "Avg PnL when Tag = Boredom is -5%."
"Avg PnL when Tag = Planned is +10%."
Quantifying the cost of emotions.

### Definition 2.2 (Playbook Building)
Identifying "A+ Setups" from the journal.
"My best trades look like X."
"My worst trades look like Y."
Strategy: Filter out Y, size up on X.
Moving from generic trading to idiosyncratic edge.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Deliberate Practice
Ericsson.
Experience alone does not create expertise (10 years of bad habits).
Expertise requires Feedback Loops.
The Journal provides the feedback.
"What did I do wrong? How do I fix it next time?"

### 3.2 Hindsight Bias Correction
Reviewing the rationale *written at the time of entry*.
"I bought because I thought X."
X didn't happen, but stock went up.
Result: "Lucky Trade."
Without the journal, memory rewrites this as "Skill."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Week-End Review
Saturday morning routine.
Review all 50 trades from the week.
Identify the "One Thing" to improve next week.
Kaizen (Continuous Improvement).

### 4.2 Screenshot Library
Visual journal.
Screenshot of the chart at entry.
Screenshot at exit.
Train the brain to recognize the pattern.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (PnL Attribution):**
Column in Excel: "Mistake?" (Yes/No).
Calculate: "PnL if No Mistakes."
Usually shows that strategy is profitable, but execution is the problem.
Empowering.

**Exercise 2 (Public Accountability):**
The "Twitter Journal."
Posting trades publicly forces discipline.
Fear of embarrassment prevents stupid trades.
(Risk: Ego defense).
