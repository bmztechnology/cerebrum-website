# Cap Rates and Valuation Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

The **Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)** is the P/E ratio reciprocal of Real Estate. It embodies the **Risk-Free Rate**, the **Risk Premium**, and the **Growth Expectation**. In microstructure terms, Cap Rates are often "sticky" (appraisal lag), creating arbitrage opportunities between the liquid REIT market (instant Cap Rate adjustment) and the private market (slow adjustment).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Gordon Growth Model for Real Estate)
$$ Price = \frac{NOI_1}{R} $$
$$ R = r_f + RP - g $$
$r_f$: Risk Free Rate (10Y Treasury).
$RP$: Risk Premium (Illiquidity, Credit).
$g$: NOI Growth rate.
If $r_f \uparrow$, $R$ should $\uparrow$ (Prices $\downarrow$), unless $g$ rises enough to offset.

### Definition 2.2 (The Band of Investment)
$$ R = (LTV \times k_d) + ((1-LTV) \times k_e) $$
Weighted average of Mortgage Constant ($k_d$) and Cash-on-Cash Return ($k_e$).
Lenders determine 65% of the Cap Rate via rates.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Cap Rate Compression vs Expansion
**Compression:** Yields falling. Prices rising. Driven by cheap debt and "Wall of Capital."
**Expansion:** Yields rising. Prices falling. Driven by Fed tightening.
Since 1980, secular compression trend.
2022 trend reversal.

### 3.2 The Spread to Treasuries
Historic Spread: Cap Rate - 10Y Yield $\approx$ 250 bps.
If Spread < 100 bps: Real Estate is expensive (Bubble?).
If Spread > 400 bps: Real Estate is cheap.
The "Risk Premium" buffer.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Value-Add Strategy
Buy at high Cap Rate (Distressed/Bad Management).
Renovate. Increase Rents ($NOI \uparrow$).
Compress Exit Cap Rate (Sell to Institutional).
Double Alpha: $NOI \uparrow$ AND $R \downarrow$.

### 4.2 Negative Leverage Arbitrage
Normally, buying a 4% Cap with 6% debt is suicide.
Unless you assume the "Going-In" Cap Rate is wrong (Market Rents > In-Place Rents).
"Mark-to-Market" the rents.
Short term negative carry for long term gain.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Hotel Valuation):**
Daily leases.
Volatile NOI.
Highest Cap Rate (e.g., 8-10%).
Highest correlation with GDP.

**Exercise 2 (Multifamily Valuation):**
Annual leases. Stable demand.
Lowest Cap Rate (e.g., 4-5%).
Agency debt (Fannie/Freddie) availability artificially suppresses Cap Rates.
