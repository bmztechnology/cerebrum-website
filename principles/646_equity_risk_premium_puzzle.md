# Equity Risk Premium Puzzle

## I. Executive Summary

The **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)** Puzzle (Mehra & Prescott 1985) is the observation that the historical return of stocks over bonds ($\approx 6\%$) is too high to be explained by standard economic models of Risk Aversion. To justify this premium, investors would need to be terrifyingly risk-averse (fearing a 10% drop as much as death). **Behavioral Finance** (Myopic Loss Aversion) offers the leading solution.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Consumption CAPM)
Standard model: We invest to smooth consumption.
Stocks are risky if they crash when consumption is low (Recession).
But consumption is smooth, stocks are volatile.
The correlation is low.
Therefore, stocks shouldn't yield such a huge premium.
Model predicts ERP < 1%. Reality > 6%.

### Definition 2.2 (Disaster Risk)
Rietz / Barro.
Maybe the model ignores "Rare Events" (Wars, Great Depression).
Stocks lose 90% in disasters.
Market prices in the tiny probability of total ruin.
"The Peso Problem."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Myopic Loss Aversion (Recap)
Benartzi & Thaler.
Premium is high because investors check prices too often.
Pain of red ink requires massive compensation.
If investors evaluated portfolios every 20 years, ERP would collapse to 1%.

### 3.2 Habit Formation
Campbell & Cochrane.
Risk aversion is not constant.
It rises as wealth approaches a "Habit Level" (Standard of living).
In recession, wealth drops near Habit level $\implies$ Risk Aversion spikes $\implies$ Prices crash.
Explains high volatility and high premium.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Strategic Asset Allocation
If ERP is a behavioral mistake (Myopic Loss Aversion), it is a free lunch for the patient.
Hold 100% Equities.
Don't look.
Capture the 6% premium.

### 4.2 Is the Premium Shrinking?
P/E ratios have expanded from 10x to 20x.
Implied ERP has fallen to 3-4%.
Why? Lower transaction costs, ETFs, perceived "Fed Put."
Or maybe investors are becoming less Myopic?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Diminishing Returns):**
If everyone accepts the "Stocks always win" thesis (Jeremy Siegel).
Prices rise. Expected returns fall.
The ERP is self-destructing via its own popularity.

**Exercise 2 (The Bond/Stock Correlation):**
ERP assumes Bonds are safe.
In Inflation (2022), Bonds and Stocks crashed together.
Safe assets became risky.
Re-evaluating the premium basis.
