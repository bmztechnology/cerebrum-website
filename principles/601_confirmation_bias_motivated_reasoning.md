# Confirmation Bias Motivated Reasoning

## I. Executive Summary

**Confirmation Bias** is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. In trading, this manifests as **"Married to the Position"**: ignoring bearish news while amplifying bullish news. It leads to **Overconfidence** and prevents the timely recognition of regime changes (e.g., "This time is different").

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Filter Bubble)
User believes $H$ (Hypothesis: Bitcoin is going to \$100k).
Search Query: "Why Bitcoin is bullish." (Positive Test Strategy).
Algorithm Feed: Show only bullish articles.
Relentless reinforcement loop.

### Definition 2.2 (Disconfirmation Bias)
When presented with opposing evidence ($E_{bear}$), the biased brain works harder to refute it.
"That analyst is an idiot / paid shill."
Cognitive Dissonance reduction.
Evidence against the position effectively *strengthens* conviction in the position.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Bayesian Failure
Bayesian Update: $P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$.
Confirmation bias distorts $P(E|H)$.
Likelihood function is manipulated by desire.
"Motivated Reasoning": Thinking driven by the desire to reach a specific conclusion.

### 3.2 The Backfire Effect
Correcting a person's misconception often makes them hold the misconception more strongly.
Implication for Bears on Wall Street: Debating Bulls is futile during a bubble.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Devil's Advocate
Institutional process.
Red Team / Blue Team.
Assign a specialized analyst to write the Short Report for every Long idea.
Must identify the "Pre-Mortem" (If this trade dies, how did it happen?).

### 4.2 Algorithmic Objectivity
Algos do not have egos.
They do not seek confirmation.
If Trend < 0, Sell.
Systematic trading is the only cure for confirmation bias?
(Unless the designer overfitted the model to confirm their bias).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Twitter/X Sentiment):**
Traders follow accounts they agree with.
Timeline becomes an echo chamber.
Strategy: Deliberately follow the smartest bears.

**Exercise 2 (The "Kill Criteria"):**
Before entering trade, write down: "I will sell if Price < X or if Yield > Y."
Commitment device.
Prevents "Moving the goalposts" when the trade goes wrong.
