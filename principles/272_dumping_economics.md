# Dumping Economics: Predatory Pricing

## I. Executive Summary

**Dumping** is the act of exporting a product at a price lower than the price charged in the home market (Price Discrimination) or lower than the cost of production (Predatory Pricing). It is widely condemned as unfair trade practice, often used by state-capitalist economies (China) to export unemployment and capture market share, driving global competitors bankrupt.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Price Discrimination Condition)
1.  Imperfect Competition (Market Power).
2.  Segmented Markets (No arbitrage/re-import allowed).
3.  Elasticity demand in Foreign Market > Home market.
Firm charges High Price at Home (Captive), Low Price Abroad (Competitive).
Surplus from Home subsidizes Foreign conquest.

### Definition 2.2 (Cyclical Dumping)
In a recession, demand falls.
High Fixed Cost industries (Steel) must keep factories running.
They sell excess output abroad at Marginal Cost (ignoring Fixed Cost).
"Looking for a home for the tons."
Global prices crash.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Predatory Dumping
Goal: Drive competitors out of market.
Then raise prices (Monopoly).
Rarely successful because new entry occurs when prices rise.
Amazon strategy? (Loss leader).

### 3.2 State Capacity Overcapacity
China's unique problem.
Local govts subsidize factories to create jobs.
Result: Massive overcapacity (producing 50% of world steel).
Domestic demand cannot absorb it.
Must Export.
"Exporting Deflation."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The China Shock (Autor)
2000-2010.
China entry to WTO.
Flood of cheap goods.
US Manufacturing employment collapsed.
Consumers benefited (Cheap Wal-Mart). Workers suffered.
Political backlash led to populism.

### 4.2 Steel Trading
If you see Chinese Steel production rising while Chinese Construction (Housing) is falling...
The surplus MUST go abroad.
Global Steel Prices will crash.
Short ArcelorMittal / US Steel.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Third Country Dumping):**
China dumps steel in Vietnam.
Vietnam makes pipes.
Vietnam exports pipes to US.
US Claims Vietnam is "Transshipping."
Rules of Origin become critical.

**Exercise 2 (Agricultural Dumping):**
US/EU dump subsidized wheat in Africa.
Price is below cost of African farmer.
African farmer goes bankrupt.
Africa becomes food dependent.
Perverse outcome of Western subsidies.
