# Narrative Economics Stories Drive Prices

## I. Executive Summary

**Narrative Economics** (Shiller) argues that **Viral Stories** drive economic events more than fundamental data. A compelling narrative (e.g., "The Internet Changes Everything," "Bitcoin is Digital Gold") spreads like an infection, altering behavior and asset prices. Investing is often an exercise in determining **Which Story** the market currently believes.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Epidemiology of Stories)
SIR Model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered).
Narrative Adoption Curve.
Early Adopters $\to$ Peak Hype (Consensus) $\to$ Fade (Boredom).
Price tracks the infection rate of the narrative.

### Definition 2.2 (Narrative Constellations)
Clusters of stories.
"Tech is the future" + "Inflation is dead" + "Fed Put."
Reinforce each other (Bull Market construct).
When one breaks (e.g., Inflation returns), the constellation collapses.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Truth vs Potency
A story doesn't need to be true to move markets (e.g., "Fake News").
It needs to be **Potent**: Simple, Emotional, Explanatory.
"The Great Depression" is a potent narrative of fear.
"The Roaring Twenties" is a potent narrative of greed.

### 3.2 Justification
Narratives are used to justify price action *ex-post*.
Market up? "Optimization narrative."
Market down? "Recession narrative."
The price creates the narrative, not vice versa? (Reflexivity).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sentiment NLP
Mining news/social media for narrative keywords.
Tracking "AI" mentions in earnings calls.
Quantifying the "Hype Cycle."

### 4.2 Fading the Story
When the taxi driver tells you the story.
The infection rate is 100%.
Herd immunity to the buy signal.
Time to sell.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Amazon Narrative):**
1999: "Profit doesn't matter, Growth matters."
2001: "Profit matters." (Crash).
2015: "Profit doesn't matter, AWS matters."
Same stock, different narrative regimes.

**Exercise 2 (Use of Metaphor):**
"Fiscal Cliff," "Taper Tantrum," "Soft Landing."
Metaphors frame our thinking and constrain our perceived options.
"Don't fight the Fed" is the ultimate Wall Street narrative.
