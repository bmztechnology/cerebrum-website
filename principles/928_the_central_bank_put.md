# The Central Bank Put

## I. Executive Summary

The **Central Bank Put** (or "Fed Put") is the market's belief that if asset prices fall below a certain level (the Strike Price), the Central Bank will intervene (Cut Rates, QE) to support them. Theoretical synthesis argues that this effectively **short-circuits Mean Reversion**, creating a **Permanent Plateau** of asset prices where downside is truncated (Public Sector Risk) and upside is privatized.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Reaction Function)
$$ R_t = f(\pi_t, y_t, S_t) $$
Taylor Rule: Rates depend on Inflation ($\pi$) and Output Gap ($y$).
Modified Rule: Rates also depend on Stock Market ($S_t$).
If $S_t$ drops 20% ("Financial Conditions Tightening"), Fed acts.
The "Put Strike" is the level of $S_t$ that triggers the cut.
Usually defined by Credit Spreads blowing out, rather than S&P level.

### Definition 2.2 (Moral Hazard)
Insurance encourages risk-taking.
If the Fed insures the market against crashes, traders leverage up.
"Privatizing Gains, Socializing Losses."
Result: Bubbles get bigger, requiring bigger bailouts.
The "Doom Loop."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Financial Dominance
When the Financial Sector > Real Economy.
Fed cannot raise rates to fight inflation if it causes a Financial Crisis.
Wall Street holds the Real Economy hostage.
"If you hike, we crash the Repo market."
Dominance shifts from Fiscal to Monetary to Financial.

### 3.2 The Infinite liquidity Assumption
Market assumes liquidity is always available.
2020: Corporate Bond market froze.
Fed bought Corporate Bonds (LQD).
Crossed the Rubicon.
Market now assumes Fed will buy *anything* (Junk, ETFs, maybe Stocks?) to prevent deflation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Buying the Dip
Historically, "Catching a falling knife" is dangerous.
In the Fed Put era, it is the optimal strategy.
"Don't fight the Fed."
Buy when VIX spikes, knowing the Fed will crush the VIX.
Reflexivity: Traders buying the dip *front-run* the Fed, doing the Fed's work for them.

### 4.2 The Taper Tantrum Hedge
Risk: Fed *removes* the Put (QT).
2013, 2018, 2022.
When Fed says "We are serious about inflation," Correl (Stock, Bond) = 1.
Put vanishes.
Hedge: Long Volatility (the only thing Fed can't print).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Greenspan Put):**
1987 Crash. Greenspan flooded liquidity.
1998 LTCM. Cut rates.
Pattern established.
Traders learned: Volatility is short-lived.

**Exercise 2 (The Powell Pivot 2019):**
Market dropped 20% in Q4 2018.
Powell (Hawk) became Powell (Dove) in Jan 2019.
"Crosscurrents."
Confirmed the Put exists even when economy is strong.
