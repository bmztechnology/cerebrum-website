# Environmental Social Governance ESG Bonds: Greenium

## I. Executive Summary

**ESG Bonds** (Green, Social, Sustainability, Sustainability-Linked) allocate proceeds to projects with positive environmental or social impacts. The market debates the existence of a **"Greenium"** (Green Premium)—a slightly lower yield (higher price) that investors accept for the "warm glow" or mandate compliance. Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs) introduce financial penalties (step-up coupons) if the issuer fails to meet KPI targets (e.g., Carbon reduction).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Taxonomy)
-   **Green Bond (Use of Proceeds):** Money ring-fenced for Solar/Wind. Bond Recourse to Issuer. (Same credit risk as non-green).
-   **Social Bond:** Affordable housing, Covid relief.
-   **SLB (Key Performance Indicator):** Money for general corporate purposes. Bond features change if ESG targets missed.

### Definition 2.2 (Greenium)
$Yield_{Green} - Yield_{Brown}$.
Empirically estimated at 1-5 bps (Basis Points).
Small, but exists mainly in Europe.
Driven by "Dark Green" funds with strict mandates.
US market is more skeptical (Greenwashing concerns).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Cost of Capital
If Greenium exists, Green firms have lower Cost of Capital.
Competitive advantage.
Encourages transition.
If Greenium is zero, ESG is just marketing.

### 3.2 Greenwashing risk
Issuer sells "Green Bond" for eco-friendly office building.
Reality: Building is standard code.
"Painting it green."
Regulators (EU SFDR) tightening standards.
Reputational risk for issuer and investor.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 SLB Arbitrage
Issuer issues SLB. Target: Cut emissions 20%.
Penalty: +25bps coupon hike.
Investor View: Issuer will fail.
Buy SLB. Treat as "Rising Coupon" bond.
Option on failure.
(Perverse incentive: Investor wants Earth to warm to get yield).

### 4.2 Sovereign Green Bonds
Germany "Twin Bonds."
Issues Green Bond and Conventional Bond with same maturity/coupon simultaneously.
Price difference is the pure market-implied Greenium.
Green bond trades at higher price.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Liquidity):**
Green bonds often held to maturity by ESG funds.
Secondary market liquidity is poor.
Liquidity Premium should raise yield?
Greenium lowers yield.
Tug of war.

**Exercise 2 (Exit Strategy):**
Divestment movement (Oil & Gas).
If funds divest, Cost of Capital for Oil rises.
Yields on Energy bonds rise.
"Sin Stock" premium.
Opportunistic (non-ESG) buyers capture higher returns.
