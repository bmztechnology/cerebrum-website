# The Purpose of Capital

## I. Executive Summary

What is Capital for? **Maintenance** (Keeping the lights on), **Growth** (More of the same), or **Evolution** (New things)? The synthesis argues that Capital is **Energy directed by Intelligence**. Its purpose is to solve problems and reduce entropy. **Impact Investing**, **ESG**, and **Venture Capital** are attempts to align Profit with Purpose.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Capital as Options)
Money is "crystallized freedom."
Optionality "to do."
If Capital is trapped (Illiquid/Zombie), it loses its purpose.
Velocity implies Purpose (Action).
Hoarding = Fear. Investment = Hope.

### Definition 2.2 (Conscious Capitalism)
Stakeholder Theory (Freeman).
Shareholders, Employees, Customers, Environment.
Optimizing for the whole system, not just EPS.
Long-term, this maximizes Shareholder Value anyway (Sustainability).
Short-term maximizing leads to extraction and death.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Schumpeter's Gale
Creative Destruction.
Capital must kill the old to feed the new.

Protecting the old (Bailouts) stops evolution.

Cleaning the forest floor.

### 3.2 Misallocation of Capital
China's Ghost Cities.
Building to hit a GDP target.
Capital destruction.
Crypto Ponzi schemes.
When Capital is too cheap, it funds nonsense.
Rate hikes restore "The Hurdle Rate" (The bar for purpose).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Venture Capital vs Private Equity
VC: Funding the New (Positive Sum).
PE: Optimizing the Old (Zero Sum / Extraction?).
Societal shift towards VC.
"Techno-Optimism."

### 4.2 The Philanthropy Pivot
Carnegie/Gates.
Accumulate ruthlessly $\to$ Distribute benevolently.
Effective Altruism (Bankman-Fried corruption).
Is it better to "Make good money" or "Make money, do good"?
Integrated Purpose.
