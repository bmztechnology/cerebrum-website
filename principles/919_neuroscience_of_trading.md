# Neuroscience of Trading

## I. Executive Summary

Trading is a biological activity. The **Limbic System** (Amygdala) processes fear/greed faster than the **Prefrontal Cortex** (Logic). Neurofinance studies hormones like **Testosterone** (Risk taking/Bubbles) and **Cortisol** (Stress/Risk aversion). Successful trading requires "Cooling" the hot brain systems to allow rational processing.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Winner Effect - Testosterone)
Winning increases Testosterone.
Testosterone increases risk tolerance and confidence.
Feedback loop: Win $\to$ T $\to$ More Risk $\to$ Win $\to$ T...
Until "Irrational Exuberance" leads to a blow-up.
Coates (2008) study on London traders.

### Definition 2.2 (The Stress Response - Cortisol)
Losing (or volatility) spikes Cortisol.
Chronic Cortisol leads to "Learned Helplessness" and Risk Aversion.
Traders "freeze" in a crash.
The "Coates Effect": Market crashes because physiology prevents traders from buying the dip.
Biological Limits to Arbitrage.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Somatic Marker Hypothesis (Damasio)
Emotions are "Somatic Markers" (gut feelings) that guide decision making.
Patients with damaged emotional centers *cannot* trade (they oscillate endlessly on decisions).
Emotion is necessary for *conviction*.
Key is regulating it, not eliminating it.

### 3.2 Dopamine Prediction Error
Dopamine is released not upon reward, but upon *unexpected* reward.
Trading is a "Variable Ratio Reinforcement Schedule" (Slot Machine).
Addictive.
Traders chase the "High" of the winning trade, ignoring the P&L.
Gamification of finance (Robinhood confetti) exploits this.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Biofeedback Trading
Wearables monitoring Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
If HRV drops (Stress), Algo locks the trader out.
"You are physiologically compromised."
Institutionalizing the "Cooling Off" period.

### 4.2 The Female Trader Advantage?
Studies show female traders blow up less.
Lower Testosterone variance?
Less "Overconfidence Bias"?
Hedge Funds actively seeking cognitive diversity to dampen biological feedback loops.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Tilt):**
Poker term.
After a bad beat, anger overrides logic.
Suboptimal play to "get it back."
Neuroscience: Amygdala hijack shuts down Prefrontal Cortex.
Solution: Walk away.

**Exercise 2 (Sleep Alpha):**
Sleep deprivation mimics intoxication.
Reduces metabolic clearance of toxins in brain.
Cognitive performance drops 30%.
"Sleep is the best risk management tool."
