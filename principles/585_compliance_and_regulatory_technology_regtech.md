# Compliance and Regulatory Technology RegTech

## I. Executive Summary

**Compliance** ensures adherence to laws (SEC, FCA) and internal policies. It has evolved from a check-the-box function to a data-driven surveillance operation (**RegTech**). Major areas include **KYC/AML** (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering), **Trade Surveillance** (Insider Trading), and **Best Execution** (MiFID II). Non-compliance carries existential massive fines and reputational ruin.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (KYC / AML)
Identity verification.
Source of Wealth checks.
Sanctions Screening (OFAC).
Transaction Monitoring (suspicious patterns).
"The cost of doing business."

### Definition 2.2 (Information Barriers / Chinese Walls)
Separating Private Side (Investment Banking) from Public Side (Trading).
Preventing flow of Material Non-Public Information (MNPI).
"Restricted Lists."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Principles vs Rules
US: Rules-based (Checklist).
UK: Principles-based ("Treat Customers Fairly").
Principles are harder to game but harder to enforce?
Convergence towards "outcomes based" regulation.

### 3.2 The RegTech Stack
NLP to read emails/chats.
Network analysis to find collusion.
Blockchain for immutable audit trails.
Replacing armies of compliance officers with software.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Best Execution
MiFID II requirement.
Must prove you got the best result for client (Price, Cost, Speed).
Requires massive data initiation (TCA).
killed "Soft Dollar" commissions in Europe (Unbundling).

### 4.2 Whistleblowing
SEC pays bounties.
Internal culture is the first line of defense.
"Tone from the top."

## V. Exercises

Navinder Sarao (Flash Crash).

**Exercise 2 (SMCR - Senior Managers Certification Regime):**
