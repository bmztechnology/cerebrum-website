# Numismatics and Grading Arbitrage

## I. Executive Summary

**Numismatics** (Rare Coins) is a market driven by **Grading** (PCGS/NGC). The difference in value between a **MS-69** (Mint State) and **MS-70** (Perfect) can be 10x, despite being indistinguishable to the naked eye. This **Step-Function Pricing** creates arbitrage opportunities for experts who can spot "Under-graded" coins and resubmit them ("Crack-out game").

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Sheldon Scale)
1 (Poor) to 70 (Perfect).
Market value is non-linear.
Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle (\$20 Gold):
MS-60: \$2000 (Bullion value).
MS-65: \$3000.
MS-67: \$50,000.
The "Condition Rarity" curve.

### Definition 2.2 (The Slab)
Plastic holder sealed by Grading Service.
"Buy the Holder, not the Coin."
The Slab transforms the coin from a subjective object to a commoditized financial asset.
CAC Stickering: Third-party verification of the Slab. "The grader of the grader."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Population Reports (Pop Reports)
Census of how many coins exist at each grade.
"Top Pop": The single finest known example.
Endless bid.
If a coin is Pop 1/0 (1 in this grade, 0 higher), it sets the record.
If a hoard is discovered (Saddle Ridge Hoard), Pop explodes $\implies$ Price crashes.

### 3.2 Subjectivity Risk
Grading is human opinion.
Resubmit the same coin 10 times.
Get grades 64, 64, 65, 64...
If the value delta 64$\to$65 is \$10k, and grading fee is \$50.
Expected Value of resubmission is positive.
The "Crack-out" strategy relies on variance.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Modern Bullion "First Strike"
Mint sells Silver Eagles.
"First Strike" labels (Packaging marketing).
Artificial scarcity created by the label, not the coin.
Secondary market usually collapses once hype fades.

### 4.2 Ancient Coins
No Sheldon Scale (Usually "Choice VF", "XF").
Provenance matters (Must date pre-1970 UNESCO treaty).
Widely unregulated.
High informational asymmetry.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The 1933 Double Eagle):**
Illegal to own (Stolen from Mint?).
One legal example sold for \$7M $\to$ \$18M.
Legal Risk factor pricing.

**Exercise 2 (Gradeflation):**
Grading standards loosen over time to encourage submissions?
An MS-65 from 1990 looks like an MS-64 today?
Or vice-versa (Standards tighten)?
Market perceives "Old Green Holders" (OGH) as conservatively graded. Premium attached.
