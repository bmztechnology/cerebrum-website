# The Passive Index Complex

## I. Executive Summary

**Passive Investing** (Index Funds/ETFs) now exceeds Active Investing. The "Big Three" (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) vote 25% of the S&P 500. This structural shift creates **Inelastic Markets** (Price insensitive buying), **Common Ownership** antitrust issues, and the **Index Inclusion Effect**. The synthesis argues that Indices are not just "Market Measures" but **Market Regulators**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Inelastic Market Hypothesis)
Gabaix / Koijen.
Passive flows are "Auto-Pilot."
"Buy \$1B of S&P irrespective of price."
Demand curve is vertical (Inelastic).
Small flows cause huge price moves.
Multiplier effect: \$1 in flows $\implies$ \$5 increase in Market Cap.

### Definition 2.2 (Index Inclusion Effect)
Stock added to S&P 500 (Tesla).
Passive funds *must* buy.
Front-runners buy beforehand.
Price spikes.
Stock removed (Macy's).
Passive funds *must* sell. Price crashes.
Indices create "Winners and Losers" via inclusion rules.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Common Ownership Theory
Airlines.
Big Three own 20% of United, Delta, American.
Do they want competition (Lower prices)? No.
they want Industry Profits (Higher prices).
Passive ownership softens competition.
Implicit collusion without communication.
Antitrust regulators are waking up to this.

### 3.2 The Marxist Moment?
Passive funds own the Means of Production.
"Universal Owners."
They can dictate ESG policies (BlackRock letter).
Centralization of corporate control in 3 boardrooms.
"Bureaucratic Socialism" via Asset Management?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Front-Running the Rebalance
Russell 2000 Rebalance (June).
Transparent rules.
Hedge Funds predict additions/deletions.
Buy Additions / Short Deletions in May.
Sell to the Passive Funds in June.
Standard Structural Alpha.

### 4.2 The Passive Bubble Thesis (Burry)
Mike Burry.
"Like CDOs."
Price is detached from value because no one is looking at value (Active discovery is dying).
If flows reverse (Baby Boomer retirement), who buys?
Liquidity mismatch.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Vote Proxy):**
Passive funds vote "Pro Management" 90% of the time?
Or rely on Proxy Advisors (ISS/Glass Lewis).
Power delegated to Proxy firms.
Agency chain: Saver $\to$ ETF $\to$ Proxy Advisor $\to$ Company.

**Exercise 2 (Dual Class Shares):**
S&P 500 bans new dual-class companies (Snap).
Indices acting as Regulators.
Forcing governance standards by denying access to capital.
