# Tax Treatment of TIPS: Phantom Income

## I. Executive Summary

**TIPS** face a disadvantageous tax structure in taxable accounts. The inflation adjustment to principal is considered **Current Income** by the IRS (OID rules) and is taxed *annually*, even though the cash is not received until maturity ("Phantom Income"). This creates a negative cash flow tax liability. Consequently, TIPS are best held in **Tax-Advantaged** accounts (IRAs, 401ks).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (OID Accretion)
Original Issue Discount rules.
Face \$1000. Inflation 10%.
New Face \$1100.
Change \$100.
Taxable Income = Coupon Cash + \$100.
Tax Bill (37%) = Coupon Tax + \$37.
If Coupon is low (0.125%), Tax Bill can exceed Cash Received.

### Definition 2.2 (Deflation Tax)
If Principal drops (Deflation).
Loss is deductible against interest income.
Reduces tax bill.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 After-Tax Real Yield
Nominal Bond: Tax on Coupon.
TIPS: Tax on Coupon + Tax on Inflation.
Inflation is effectively taxed.
Purchasing power protection is eroded by taxes.
"Inflation Tax" is literal here.
To maintain *After-Tax* Real Purchasing Power, TIPS yield must be higher.

### 3.2 Municipal TIPS?
Rare.
Tax-Free Inflation Linked bonds.
Would solve the problem.
Few issuers (Pension bonds?).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Asset Location
Put TIPS in Traditional IRA / Roth IRA.
Put Municipal Bonds / Stocks in Taxable.
Standard advice.
ETFs (TIP) handle the K-1/1099 complexity, but you still pay the tax on distributions.

### 4.2 Breakeven Distortion
Taxable investors dominate Nominal market?
Tax-Exempt (Pensions/Foreigners) dominate TIPS?
Different marginal tax rates affect the Breakeven pricing.
$BEI_{market} \ne BEI_{economic}$.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Sales):**
Sell TIPS before maturity.
Principal adjustment is part of basis?
No, adjusted basis tracks the accretion.
Capital Gain/Loss is strictly Price Change relative to Adjusted Principal.

**Exercise 2 (I-Bonds):**
Savings Bonds (Retail).
Tax Deferred until redemption.
Solver the Phantom Income problem.
But cap (\$10k/year) limits institutional use.
