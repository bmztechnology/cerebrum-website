# Heuristics and Rules of Thumb

## I. Executive Summary

**Heuristics** are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making. While they lead to biases (anchoring, availability), they are essential for functioning in a complex world. In trading, professional intuition is a set of **Adaptive Heuristics** honed by experience (e.g., "Don't catch a falling knife," "Buy the dip"). The danger lies in applying heuristics to the wrong context.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Attribute Substitution)
Answering a hard question by answering an easier one.
Hard: "Is General Electric undervalued relative to its future cash flows?"
Easy: "Do I like GE products?" (Affect Heuristic).
Trading based on the easy answer.

### Definition 2.2 (The 1/N Heuristic)
Asset Allocation.
Split money equally among options offered.
If 401k offers 1 Stock Fund and 1 Bond Fund $\implies$ 50/50.
If 401k offers 4 Stock Funds and 1 Bond Fund $\implies$ 80/20.
Allocation depends on the menu, not the risk.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Technical Analysis as Heuristic
"Head and Shoulders," "Support/Resistance."
Visual heuristics to interpret crowd psychology.
Not physics, but "Focal Points" (Game Theory).
If everyone follows the heuristic, it becomes self-fulfilling.

### 3.2 Ecological Rationality
A heuristic is "rational" if it fits the environment.
Limit Order Book: "Follow the liquidity."
If the order book is thin, the heuristic works.
If HFT is spoofing, the heuristic fails.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Checklist Manifesto
Gawande.
Formalizing heuristics into a Checklist.
1. Is Trend Up?
2. Is Volatility Low?
3. Is Earnings Positive?
Reduces error rate. De-biases the heat of the moment.

### 4.2 Rules of Thumb
"Sell in May and Go Away."
"The Trend is Your Friend."
"Don't Fight the Fed."
Distilled wisdom or old wives' tales?
Quantifying them often reveals weak statistical power but high psychological utility (regret minimization).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The PEAD Heuristic):**
Post Earnings Announcement Drift.
Heuristic: "If Earnings Surprise > 10%, Buy and Hold 30 days."
Exploits the Anchoring bias of others.

**Exercise 2 (Menu Dependence):**
Broker app interface.
"Top Movers" list.
Heuristic: "Buy what is moving."
Leads to chasing.
Interface design shapes the heuristics used.
