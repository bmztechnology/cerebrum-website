# Geopolitics of Property and Safe Havens

## I. Executive Summary

Real Estate is immobile, making it uniquely vulnerable to **Geopolitical Risk** (War, Expropriation, Sanctions). However, High-End Real Estate in stable democracies (London, NYC, Singapore) serves as a **Global Safe Haven** and a vehicle for **Capital Flight**. The microstructure of "Oligarch Flows" drives pricing in Prime Central London (PCL) far above local economic fundamentals.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Safe Haven Premium)
Price = Fundamental Value (Rents) + Insurance Value (Safety).
Investors pay negative real yields (Expenses > Rents) just to park capital outside an authoritarian regime.
"Safety Deposit Box" with a view.

### Definition 2.2 (Tier 1 Global Cities)
Sassen's Global City hypothesis.
London, NY, Tokyo, Singapore.
Deep liquidity. Rule of Law.
Prices correlate with *Global* Wealth, not *Local* Wages.
Decoupling of housing market from the population.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Money Laundering via Real Estate
Large ticket size.
Opaque ownership (Shell Companies / BVI).
Minimal scrutiny (until recently).
"All Cash" transactions bypassing banks.
The "Vancouver Model."

### 3.2 Expropriation Risk
In Hostile Jurisdictions, Real Estate is a liability (immobile).
In Friendly Jurisdictions, it is a fortress.
Sanctions (2022 against Russia) froze assets.
Safe Havens became "Traps" for sanctioned individuals.
Shift to Dubai (Neutral).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Golden Visas
Buy €500k Property $\to$ Get EU Residency (Portugal/Greece).
Microstructure: Artificial floor on property prices at the Visa threshold.
Policy change (ending Golden Visa) crash prices instantly.

### 4.2 The "Lights Out" Indicator
Walking through upscale neighborhoods (Mayfair / Billionaires' Row) at night.
No lights.
Ghost towers.
High "Shadow Inventory."
Indicates the market is driven by capital preservation, not housing utility.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Capital Control Evasion):**
Chinese nationals limited to \$50k export/year.
How to buy \$5M Vancouver home?
Underground banking (Smurfing).

Impact on local affordability crises.

**Exercise 2 (The London Discount):**
Brexit + Taxes on Foreign Buyers.
London prices stagnated relative to US.
Market pricing in the "Policy Risk."
