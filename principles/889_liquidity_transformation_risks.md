# Liquidity Transformation Risks

## I. Executive Summary

**Liquidity Transformation** is the core function of banking: taking liquid liabilities (Deposits) and buying illiquid assets (Loans). In Alternatives (Private Credit, Real Estate Funds), this mismatch creates **Run Risk**. Funds promise **Quarterly Liquidity** while holding assets that take **Years to Sell**. The microstructure of "Gates" and "Suspensions" manages this tension.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Mismatch Ratio)
$$ D_{Assets} >> D_{Liabilities} $$
(Duration of liquidity).
Open-Ended Real Estate Fund (BREIT).
Investors can redeem monthly.
Buildings take 6 months to sell.
If 5% of investors redeem $\implies$ Pay from Cash buffer.
If 20% redeem $\implies$ Fire sale of buildings? Or Gate the fund?

### Definition 2.2 (Gating)
"Redemption Gate."
Clause: "If requests > 2% of NAV/month, we stop paying."
Protects remaining investors from fire-sale dilution.
But destroys trust.
"Strategic Redemption": Investors redeem *before* the gate hits. Panic cycle.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 First Mover Advantage
In a mutual fund holding illiquid bonds.
Transaction costs of selling bonds are high (Bid-Ask spread 2%).
If Fund pays exiting investors at NAV (ignoring spread), the *remaining* investors eat the cost.
Incentive: Run first.
Solution: **Swing Pricing** (Adjust NAV down for leavers to pass the cost to them).

### 3.2 Shadow Banking Run
2020 Dash for Cash.
Bond Funds faced massive outflows.
Couldn't sell Corporate Bonds fast enough.
Fed stepped in (SMCCF) to buy bonds.
Moral Hazard: Fed backstopping the Liquidity Mismatch of private funds.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Semi-Liquid Structure
"Interval Funds."
Continuous offering.
Repurchases limited to 5% per quarter.
Honest signaling: "This is not a checking account."
Market growing as Retail demands access to Private Credit.

### 4.2 Secondary Market for LP Interests
Investors trapped in a gated fund.
Sell their stake on Secondary Market (Secondaries).
Price: NAV - 30%.
Liquidity has a price.
Price discovery reveals the true mark of the assets.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Blackstone B-REIT):**
2022/2023.
Investors hit the 5% monthly gate for 12 months straight.
Blackstone limited withdrawals.
Protected the NAV.
Ultimately stabilized.
Success case of Gating?

**Exercise 2 (Woodford Equity Income):**
Neil Woodford (UK).
Held private biotech stocks in an open-ended mutual fund.
Kent Council asked for withdrawals.
Couldn't sell.
Fund frozen. Liquidated.
Investors lost money.
Failure case.
