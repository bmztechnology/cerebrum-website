# Whole Business Securitization WBS: Franchise

## I. Executive Summary

**Whole Business Securitization (WBS)** allows companies (typically Franchisors like Domino's, Dunkin', Taco Bell) to pledge their **Revenue Generating Assets** (Franchise Agreements, IP, Royalties) to an SPV. The SPV issues debt. This structure allows higher leverage (5-7x EBITDA) and lower cost of interest than traditional High Yield bonds, because the Debt has control over the cash-generating "engine" of the business.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The IP Ringfence)
Company transfers Trademark/IP to SPV.
Franchisees pay royalties directly to SPV.
SPV pays interest to Bondholders.
Excess cash flows back to Company (Dividend).
If Company defaults, Bondholders own the Brand and Royalties.

### Definition 2.2 (DSCR Covenants)
Debt Service Coverage Ratio of the Securitization.
If DSCR < Trigger (e.g., 1.5x): Cash Trap (Company gets no dividends).
If DSCR < Default (e.g., 1.2x): Rapid Amortization (Principal repay).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Operational Risk
Unlike Mortgage/Auto (Financial Assets), WBS relies on the *operation* of the brand.
"Manager" (The Company) must keep selling pizzas.
Bondholders need a "Back-up Manager" plan.
Usually, the Franchise structure is resilient (Franchisees keep operating even if ParentCo fails).

### 3.2 Leverage Arbitrage
OpCo leverages at 6x cheap (investment grade like pricing).
Refinances old HY debt.
Pays massive dividend to Private Equity owners.
"Asset Stripping"? Or "Efficient Capital Structure"?

## IV. Strategic Applications
