# Real Yields Gold Correlation: The Anti-Dollar

## I. Executive Summary

**Gold** is often modeled as a zero-coupon, infinite-duration asset with a real yield of zero. Therefore, its price is inversely correlated with **Real Yields** (TIPS). When Real Yields rise, the opportunity cost of holding Gold (which pays no income) increases, and Gold falls. Empirically, the correlation between Gold and 10Y Real Yields is roughly -0.8 to -0.9 during standard regimes.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Opportunity Cost Model)
$$ Price_{Gold} \propto \frac{1}{RealYield} $$
Rationale: Gold protects purchasing power.
TIPS also protect purchasing power + pay interest $r$.
If $r$ is high, buy TIPS. Sell Gold.
If $r$ is negative, TIPS charge you to hold purchasing power. Gold (cost 0) is better.

### Definition 2.2 (Currency Debasement)
Gold rises when Trust in Fiat falls.
Real Yields are the price of Fiat Capital.
Collapse in Real Yields $\implies$ Central Bank is repressing rates (Financial Repression) $\implies$ Debasement.
Gold rallies.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Breakdown (2022-2023)
Real Yields spiked from -1.0% to +2.0% (Massive hiking).
Model predicted Gold crash to \$1200.
Gold stayed at \$2000.
Why?
1.  **Central Bank Buying:** China/Russia accumulating Gold (Geopolitics > Rates).
2.  **Fiat Distrust:** Weaponization of USD reserves.

### 3.2 Duration of Gold
Sensitivity to rates implies duration.
If Real Rates +100bps $\implies$ Gold -20%?
Implied "Duration" of 20 years.
Highly sensitive asset.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 TIPS + Gold Portfolio
Diversification.
TIPS: Income + Inflation Hedge.
Gold: Tail Risk + Currency Hedge + Inflation Hedge.
Overlapping but distinct roles.

### 4.2 Mining Stocks
Miners = Leveraged Gold.
Have operational costs (Diesel, Labor - Inflation sensitive).
Correlation to Real Yields is even higher than Spot Gold.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Neutral Rate):**
$r^*$.
Equilibrium Real Rate.
Gold determines market view of $r^*$.
If Gold is high despite high nominal rates, Market thinks $r^*$ is low (Inflation will persist).

**Exercise 2 (Silver):**
Silver has industrial component.
Higher correlation to Manufacturing cycle.
Gold is pure monetary asset.
