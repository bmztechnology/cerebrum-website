# Pharmacological Finance

## I. Executive Summary

**Pharmacological Finance** examines how substances (Caffeine, Nicotine, Amphetamines, Cocaine, Beta Blockers) alter financial decision-making. Trading floors have a history of stimulant abuse to maintain focus ("The Wolf of Wall Street"), but stimulants often increase **Overconfidence** and **churning**. Conversely, **Beta Blockers** (used by musicians) can reduce cortisol/tremors and potentially improve "cool-headed" risk taking.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stimulants: Dopamine Agonists)
Cocaine/Adderall.
Increase Dopamine availability.
Effect: Higher focus, Higher confidence, Higher risk taking.
Lo & Repin: Traders on stimulants trade more frequently and hold positions for shorter times.
"Action bias."

### Definition 2.2 (Depressants/Anxiolytics)
Alcohol/Xanax.
Reduce inhibitions (GABA).
"Liquid Courage."
Effect: Ignored stops, "Hope" trading.
Disaster for discipline.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Coffee Cycle
Caffeine blocks Adenosine (Sleepiness).
Half-life 6 hours.
Morning: Focus boost (Performance $\uparrow$).
Afternoon: Crash (Performance $\downarrow$).
Trader mood (and market liquidity?) tracks the caffeine cycle of the desk.

### 3.2 Beta Blockers
Inhibit Adrenaline.
Reduce physical symptoms of stress (Shaking, sweating).
Do they improve decisions?
Study: Lo.
Traders on Beta Blockers might be "too calm" (lack of intuition)?
Or perfect for "Execution Traders" who need to be robotic.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 "Smart Drugs" (Nootropics)
Modafinil.
Silicon Valley / Wall Street trend.
Goal: Sustained vigilance without the jitteriness of Adderall.
Ethical/Health risks.
Is it "Doping" in finance? (No regulations yet).

### 4.2 The Hangover Effect
Monday morning volume/volatility.
Impact of weekend substance use?
"Irish Bank Strikes": When banks closed, alcohol consumption dropped?
Link between sobriety and market efficiency.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Caffeine Fast):**
Quit coffee for 2 weeks.
Observe baseline focus.
Most traders realize they are just treating withdrawal symptoms, not gaining energy.

**Exercise 2 (State Dependent Learning):**
If you learn to trade on caffeine/nicotine, you might only be able to trade well on caffeine/nicotine.
The brain associates the state with the skill.
dependency trap.
