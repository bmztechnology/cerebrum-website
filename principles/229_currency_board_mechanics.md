# Currency Board Mechanics: The Hard Peg

## I. Executive Summary

A **Currency Board** is the strictest form of Fixed Exchange Rate. The monetary authority is stripped of all discretion. It can only issue domestic currency if it is 100% backed by foreign reserve currency. The most famous example is the **Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)**, which pegs HKD to USD at 7.75-7.85.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Balance Sheet Rule)
Assets: USD Reserves.
Liabilities: HKD Monetary Base.
Rule: $\Delta Base = \Delta Reserves$.
You cannot print HKD to buy bonds (QE). You can only print HKD if someone gives you USD.

### Definition 2.2 (Automatic Adjustment Mechanism)
If Capital Flows Out (Selling HKD):
1.  HKMA sells USD to buy HKD (Support Peg).
2.  HKD Monetary Base shrinks.
3.  HKD Interest Rates (HIBOR) rise.
4.  High Rates attract Capital back.
System self-corrects via Interest Rate pain.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Imported Monetary Policy
Hong Kong outsources policy to the Fed.
If US hikes, HK waits. Capital flows out. HIBOR rises. HK effectively hikes.
Problem: If HK is in recession but US is booming (Hiking), HK is forced to hike into a recession.
Cost of Stability = Lack of Flexibility.

### 3.2 The Strong Side / Weak Side
HKD trades in a band (7.75 - 7.85).
Strong Side (7.75): HKMA sells HKD, buys USD. (Base expands).
Weak Side (7.85): HKMA sells USD, buys HKD. (Base shrinks).
Trading Strategy: "Carry Trade" inside the band.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Kyle Bass Short
Thesis: HK reserves are insufficient compared to the banking system size.
Response: HKMA has massive reserves ($400B) for a tiny Base.
The "Short HKD" trade is widely known as the "Widowmaker."

### 4.2 Property Market Link
Since HK cannot devalue currency to adjust competitiveness, asset prices must adjust.
HK Property is the most volatile in the world because it acts as the shock absorber for the Peg.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Argentina 2001):**
Had a Currency Board (1 Peso = 1 USD).
But Fiscal Policy was reckless (Deficits).
Central Bank printed money "via back door" (quasi-fiscal notes).
Peg broke. Economic collapse.
Lesson: Currency Board requires Fiscal Discipline.

**Exercise 2 (Arbitrage):**
If USD/HKD = 7.86 (Outside band).
Risk-free Arb: Buy at market, Sell to HKMA at 7.85.
HKMA guarantee is ironclad (so far).
