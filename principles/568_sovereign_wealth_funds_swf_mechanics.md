# Sovereign Wealth Funds SWF Mechanics

## I. Executive Summary

**Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)** are state-owned investment funds. They typically originate from **Commodity Surpluses** (Oil: Norway, UAE) or **Trade Surpluses** (China, Singapore). Unlike Central Bank Reserves (which hold short-term US Treasuries for liquidity), SWFs invest for **Intergenerational Transfer** or **Fiscal Stabilization**, allowing them to take massive risks in Illiquids, Equities, and Real Estate. They are the "Whales" of global finance.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stabilization Fund)
Goal: Smooth government budget.
Oil Price High $\implies$ Deposit excess revenue.
Oil Price Low $\implies$ Withdraw to fund budget.
Liquidity preference: Medium.
Risk tolerance: Low/Medium.

### Definition 2.2 (Savings / Future Gen Fund)
Goal: Wealth for when the oil runs out.
Horizon: 50+ years.
Risk tolerance: Very High.
Asset Allocation: 70% Equities / 30% Alts.
Example: Norges Bank (GPFG).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Dutch Disease
Large resource exports $\implies$ Currency appreciates $\implies$ Manufacturing becomes uncompetitive.
SWF solution: Capital recycle.
Take export dollars, invest them *abroad*.
Keeps domestic currency lower.
Prevents overheating of domestic economy.

### 3.2 Political Risk
SWFs are state actors.
Are they investing for ROI or for Geopolitical leverage?
CFIUS (USA) reviews bold SWF acquisitions of strategic assets (Ports, Tech).
"The Santiago Principles": Voluntary code of conduct for SWF transparency.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Contrarian Capital
2008 Crisis: SWFs bailed out Citigroup, UBS, Morgan Stanley.
"Capital of Last Resort."
They extracted high yields (10% Preferreds).
Provided stability to the global system.

### 4.2 Direct Investment
Moving away from external managers (Fees).
Building internal teams (Direct Private Equity).
Buying airports, football clubs (PSG, Man City), and skyscrapers directly.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Norway Model vs Yale Model):**
Norway: 70% Public Equities / 30% Bonds. Low cost, Beta focused.
Yale: 50% Illiquids. High Alpha, Manager selection.
Why does Norway avoid PE? Size constraint. (Fund is too big to move needle with PE).

**Exercise 2 (Withdrawal Rules):**
Fiscal Rule: Government can only spend the *Real Return* (e.g., 3%).
Protect the principal.
If spend > return $\implies$ Dutch Disease returns.
