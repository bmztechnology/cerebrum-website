# Fund of Funds FoF: Allocators

## I. Executive Summary

A **Fund of Funds (FoF)** invests in a portfolio of other hedge funds rather than trading directly. The value proposition is **Access** (getting into closed, famous funds), **Due Diligence** (vetting managers), and **Diversification**. However, the **Double Layer of Fees** ("1 and 10" on top of "2 and 20") makes it difficult to outperform simple indices. FoFs are declining but remain relevant for small institutions needing turnkey exposure.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Double Leverage)
FoF can apply leverage at the top level.
$Leverage_{total} = Leverage_{FoF} \times Leverage_{Underlying}$.
Risk amplification.

### Definition 2.2 (Gating)
Liquidity mismatch.
FoF allows quarterly redemptions.
Underlying funds have 1-year lockups.
In a crisis, FoF cannot get cash to pay investors.
Must "Gate" (Block) withdrawals.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Selection Alpha
Can you pick winning managers?
Momentum in manager performance?
Persistence of returns is debatable.
Survivorship bias in indices.
Real alpha is identifying new talent (Emerging Managers) before they get big and dull.

### 3.2 Operational Due Diligence (ODD)
Checking the plumbing.
Is the custodian real? Are the audits legit?
Madoff screen.
FoF allows investors to outsource this expensive checking.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Multi-Manager Platforms vs FoF
Platforms (Citadel) employ managers. Better control, better netting, one fee layer.
FoF invests in external managers. Less control, double fees.
Trend determines that Capital flows to Platforms, away from FoF.

### 4.2 Customized Mandates
"Fund of One."
Large pension asks FoF to build a specific "ESG Long/Short" portfolio.
Consultative sales approach.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fee Drag):**
Underlying: 10% gross, 2/20 fees $\implies$ 6.4% net.
FoF: Takes 1/10 on the 6.4%.
Investor Net: $\approx 4.7\%$.
Needs massive gross returns to justify.

**Exercise 2 (Correlation of Manager A & B):**
If Manager A is effectively Long Beta, and Manager B is Long Beta.
FoF is just expensive Beta.
True FoF value is combining uncorrelated streams.
