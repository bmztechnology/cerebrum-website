# Critical Minerals Supply: The Green Bottle-neck

## I. Executive Summary

The Energy Transition requires shifting from a fuel-intensive system (Oil/Gas) to a **Material-Intensive** system (Wind/Solar/Battery). This creates exponential demand for **Critical Minerals**: Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, Graphite. The supply side is constrained by declining ore grades, long lead times (10-15 years to open a mine), and ESG opposition to mining. A structural squeeze is inevitable.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Metal Intensity)
-   EV Car requires 6x more minerals than Internal Combustion Car.
-   Offshore Wind requires 9x more minerals than Gas Plant (per MW).
Transition = Massive demand shock.

### Definition 2.2 (Cost Curves)
Marginal Cost of Production determines price floor.
Lithium Carbonate cost curve is steep.
Brine (South America) is cheap ($5k/ton).
Hard Rock (Australia) is mid ($10k/ton).
Lepidolite (China) is expensive ($20k/ton).
Price is set by the marginal high-cost producer needed to clear demand.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Lassonde Curve
Life cycle of a mining stock.
1.  Discovery (Price Spike).
2.  Orphan Period (Feasibility/Permitting - Price Crash). Time: 5-7 years. "The Valley of Death."
3.  Construction.
4.  Production (Re-rating).
Investors usually buy too early (Phase 1) and sell before the real value (Phase 4).

### 3.2 Geopolitical Concentration
Cobalt: 70% from DRC (Congo). Refined in China.
Lithium: 60% refined in China.
Nickel: Indonesia allows Chinese dominance.
The West has "Resource Insecurity."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Substitution Risk
If Cobalt goes to $100k/ton.
Battery markers switch to LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) which uses zero Cobalt.
Demand destruction.
Technology evolves to thrift out expensive metals.
Lithium is harder to substitute (Charge carrier). Copper is physics (Conductivity).

### 4.2 Recycling
"Urban Mining."
Eventually (20 years), spent batteries provide supply.
Currently, not enough stock to recycle.
Primary mining is the only path for now.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Nickel Squeeze 2022):**
Tsingshan (Chinese giant) had a massive Short position.
Price spiked. Margin call.
LME (London Metal Exchange) Cancelled trades to save them.
Market credibility destroyed.
Physical shortage meets Financial leverage.

**Exercise 2 (Permitting in USA):**
Resolving Resolution Copper mine (Arizona).
Can supply 25% of US demand.
Blocked for 15 years by Environmental/Native American objections.
The paradox: "We want EVs, but no Mines."
