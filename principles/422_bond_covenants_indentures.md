# Bond Covenants Indentures: The Contract

## I. Executive Summary

**Covenants** are the legal clauses in the **Indenture** (Bond Contract) that protect creditors from shareholder abuse. **Negative Covenants** restrict actions (e.g., no more debt). **Affirmative Covenants** require actions (e.g., file reports). **Maintenance Covenants** (common in Loans, rare in Bonds) test ratios quarterly. Weak covenants ("Covenant Lite") allow companies to strip value, leading to lower recovery rates.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Restricted Payments - RP)
Limits Dividends and Share Buybacks.
Usually built on a "Builder Basket" (50% of Net Income accumulates in basket).
Prevents draining cash to equity holders.

### Definition 2.2 (Debt Incurrence)
Limits issuing new debt.
Test: Pro-forma Interest Coverage ratio must be > 2.0x.
Exception: "Permitted Liens" (Working capital lines).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Change of Control (CoC) Put

Creditor on Creditor violence.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Covenant Stripping
In a tender offer, Issuer offers to buy back bonds at premium.
Condition: Investors must vote to "Strip" (Remove) covenants from the old bonds.
Forces holdouts to tender (Prisoner's Dilemma).
If you don't tender, you are left with an empty shell bond.

### 4.2 Make Whole Call
Call option that pays PV of remaining coupons at Treasury + 50bps.
Very expensive to exercise.
Effectively protects investor from early call, while technically allowing it.
Standard in IG bonds.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Cross Default):**
If company defaults on Bank Loan ($10M).
It triggers Cross Default on Bond ($1B).
Even if Bond interest is paid.
Prevents "Selective Default."

**Exercise 2 (Equity Cure):**

Sponsor injects cash (Equity Cure) to pay down debt and fix ratio.
Allows owner to keep control.
