# Currency Manipulation Labels: The Treasury's Stick

## I. Executive Summary

The US Treasury officially designates countries as **Currency Manipulators** based on specific criteria defined by the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act and 2015 Trade Act. The designation is a political weapon used to force trading partners to appreciate their currencies (reduce US trade deficit). It carries the threat of tariffs and exclusion from US government procurement.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Three Criteria - 2015 Act)
A country is a Manipulator if:
1.  **Bilateral Trade Surplus** with US > $20B.
2.  **Current Account Surplus** > 2% of GDP.
3.  **Persistent One-Sided Intervention** (Buying FX) > 2% of GDP over 12 months.

### Definition 2.2 (Monitoring List)
If a country meets 2 of 3 criteria.
"Watch List."
Effect: "Naming and Shaming." Market pressure.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Mercantilism Policing
The US acts as the consumer of last resort.
It refuses to tolerate partners who chronically suppress domestic consumption to dump exports.
The criteria target the "Savings Glut" structure.

### 3.2 Political Discretion
China labeled Manipulator in 2019 (Trade War).
Removed in 2020 (Phase 1 Deal).
Did China's economics change? No.
The label is a negotiation lever.
Switzerland/Vietnam often technically qualify but get a pass (Geopolitics).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Counter-Trade
If country placed on Monitoring List.
Expect Central Bank to STOP intervening (buying USD).
Currency will Appreciate.
Trade: Long Currency vs USD.
Example: Taiwan often allows TWD strength right before the Treasury Report release.

### 4.2 Tariffs Link
Section 301.
Designation justifies punitive tariffs.
Macro impact: Stagflation (Higher import prices, lower growth).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Plaza Accord 2.0?):**
US Treasury complains about strong Dollar.
Might label Germany/Japan manipulators?
Unlikely among allies.
Focus is usually on Rivals (China) or small surplus nations (Vietnam).

**Exercise 2 (Reverse Manipulation):**
What if a country intervenes to STRENGTHEN its currency (Selling USD)?
Not considered manipulation by Treasury.
US Treasury only hates it when you *weaken* your currency.
Asymmetry: US wants strong foreign currencies.
