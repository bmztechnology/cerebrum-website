# Allais Paradox Certainty Effect

## I. Executive Summary

The **Allais Paradox** (Maurice Allais, 1953) demonstrates that human choices violate the **Independence Axiom** of Expected Utility Theory. People disproportionately value **Certainty** (100% probability). We will trade a huge amount of Expected Value to move from 99% to 100%, but act risk-neutrally when moving from 34% to 35%. This **Certainty Effect** underpins insurance and guarantee industries.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Paradox)
**Experiment 1:**
A: 100% chance of \$1M.
B: 89% of \$1M, 10% of \$5M, 1% of \$0.
Most pick A (Fear of the 1% zero). $EV(B) > EV(A)$.

**Experiment 2 (Scaled Down):**
C: 11% chance of \$1M.
D: 10% chance of \$5M.
Most pick D (Go for the big win, risk is similar).
This pairing (A & D) is mathematically inconsistent under EUT.

### Definition 2.2 (The Certainty Effect)
$\pi(1.0) \gg \pi(0.99)$.
The transition from "Possibility" to "Certainty" carries a massive psychological premium ("Pseudo-Certainty").
Zero Risk Bias.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regret Theory
Picking B and hitting the 1% zero causes massive Regret ("I could have had \$1M for sure!").
Picking D and losing (90% chance) cause no regret ("I probably wasn't going to win anyway").
We pay the premium in A to avoid the Regret.

### 3.2 Prospect Theory Weighting
Probability Weighting Function $w(p)$ is steep near 0 and 1.
We overweigh small probabilities (Lottery).
We underweigh high probabilities (Insurance).
We crave the "100%."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Principal Protection
Structured Products: "100% Capital Guaranteed."
Investors accept terrible yields (0.5%) for this guarantee.
The "Cost of Certainty" is the bank's profit margin.

### 4.2 Dividend Aristocrats
"Certain" dividends.
Stocks behave like bonds.
Valuation premium for reliability.
Any cut in dividend destroys the "Certainty" status and crashes the stock (e.g., GE).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Russian Roulette):**
1 bullet in 6 chambers. Willing to pay \$X to remove it.
2 bullets in 6 chambers. Willing to pay \$Y to remove one.
Result: \$X \gg \$Y.
Reducing risk from 1/6 to 0/6 (Death to Life) is worth infinity.
Reducing from 2/6 to 1/6 is worth less.

**Exercise 2 (The 99% Trade):**
Selling deep OTM puts.
Win rate 99%.
Feels like "Free Money" (Certainty).
The explosion (1% risk) wipes out all previous gains.
Taleb's "Turkey Problem."
