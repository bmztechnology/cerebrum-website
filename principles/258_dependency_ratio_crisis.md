# Dependency Ratio Crisis: The Silver Tsunami

## I. Executive Summary

The **Dependency Ratio** measures the burden on the working-age population (15-64) to support the non-working population (Under 15 + Over 65). As the world ages (Aging Demographics), this ratio is skyrocketing. The economic consequence is **Secular Stagnation**: Lower Growth (fewer workers), Lower Interest Rates (savings glut of the old), and Disinflation... until the labor shortage eventually causes Inflation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Ratio)
$$DR = \frac{Population_{0-14} + Population_{65+}}{Population_{15-64}} \times 100$$
-   Golden Age: Low DR (Post-WWII Baby Boom entering workforce). "Demographic Dividend."
-   Silver Tsunami: High DR (Boomers retiring). "Demographic Tax."
Japan's DR > 70% (Sustainable limit is considered 50%).

### Definition 2.2 (Life Cycle Hypothesis - Modigliani)
-   Young: Borrow.
-   Middle: Save (Peak Earnings).
-   Old: Dissave (Spend down assets).
If the world is "Middle Aged" (2000-2020), Savings Glut $\to$ Low Rates.
If the world is "Old" (2020+), Dissaving $\to$ Rates Rise?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Japanification
Japan peaked in 1990. Workers shrank.
GDP flattened.
Deflation set in.
Why? Old people don't buy houses/cars. Aggregate Demand falls faster than Supply?
Not necessarily. Labor Supply falls $\to$ Wages Rise?
Japan used Automation to offset.

### 3.2 The Great Demographic Reversal (Goodhart)
Argument: Globalization + China demographics kept inflation low for 30 years.
Now China is shrinking.
Labor is scarce globally.
Power shifts from Capital to Labor.
Result: Structural Inflation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long Healthcare / Short Consumer Discretionary
Old people spend 5x more on Healthcare.
Young people buy Sneakers/Phones.
Demographics is the longest duration trade.
Short Toys R Us (Kids shrinking), Long Funeral Homes (SCI).

### 4.2 Real Estate Micro
Suburbs die (Boomers sell 4-bedroom houses).
City Centers with elevators thrive?
Or Retirement Communities (Florida) boom.
Japan: "Akiya" (Empty houses) given away for free in rural areas.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (China's One Child Policy):**
Created a massive dividend (1980-2015).
Now creating a massive cliff.
China will lose 40% of its workforce by 2100.
"The 4-2-1 Problem" (1 child supports 2 parents and 4 grandparents).

**Exercise 2 (Inflation Hedge):**
If Labor Scarcity is the future.
Wages will rise.
Services Inflation will be sticky.
Long TIPS (Inflation Protected Securities) is a demographic hedge.
