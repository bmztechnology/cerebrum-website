# Fund of Funds and Fee Layering

## I. Executive Summary

**Fund of Funds (FoF)** aggregates capital to invest in other PE/VC funds. It offers **Diversification** and **Access** (to top-tier funds like Sequoia that are closed to new investors). The microstructure downside is **Fee Layering** (Double Fees) and **Over-Diversification** (Indexing).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Fee Structure)
Underlying Fund: 2% Management + 20% Carry.
FoF: 1% Management + 10% Carry (on top).
$$ \text{Net Return} = \text{Gross} \times (1-F_1) \times (1-F_2) $$
Hurdle rates become harder to hit.
FoF must demonstrate "Selection Alpha" to justify fees.

### Definition 2.2 (Blind Pool vs Co-Invest)
**Blind Pool:** Investing in the FoF before underlying funds are picked.
**Co-Investment:** FoF invests directly into a deal alongside the GP.
Lower fees (No fee/No carry on Co-Invest).
Used to blend down the aggregate fee load.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Access Premium
Sequoia/Benchmark do not take money from random dentists.
They take from Endowments and... Top Tier FoF (HarbourVest).
FoF sells "Access."
Is the access worth the fee?
Power Law says yes (if you get into the *best*, fees don't matter).

### 3.2 Dampening Volatility
Single VC Fund: High dispersion (0x to 10x).
FoF: Low dispersion (1.5x to 2.5x).
Institutional Quality fit for Pensions.
"Beta of Private Markets."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Emerging Managers
Large Pensions cannot write small checks (\$5M).
Emerging Managers (Seed Funds) need small checks.
FoF acts as the aggregator/intermediary.
Discovering the "Next Generation" of GPs (Alpha source).

### 4.2 Secondaries as a Tool
FoF buys secondary stakes to deploy capital fast (mitigate J-curve).
Tactical allocation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The J-Curve shape):**
FoF J-curve is flatter.
Capital calls are staggered across 20 underlying funds.
Distributions start earlier.
Smoother cash flow profile.

**Exercise 2 (The Denominator Effect):**
If Public market crashes.
Pension is overweight PE.
Stops committing to FoF.
FoF fundraising cycles are pro-cyclical.
