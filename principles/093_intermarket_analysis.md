# Intermarket Analysis: The Global Web

## I. Executive Summary

No asset trades in a vacuum. Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, and Currencies are interconnected gears in the global economic machine. Intermarket Analysis (John Murphy) uses the correlation and lead/lag relationships between these sectors to confirm trends and warn of reversals. For Forex traders, analyzing the Bond Market (Yields) and Commodities (Oil/Gold) is mandatory for directional bias.

## II. The Four Pillars

1.  **Currencies (The Mechanism):** USD, EUR, JPY.
2.  **Commodities (The Inputs):** Oil (Energy), Gold (Inflation/Fear), Copper (Growth).
3.  **Bonds (The Cost of Capital):** US 10-Year Treasury (Yields).
4.  **Equities (The Output):** S&P 500, Nikkei.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Inflationary/Deflationary Axis
-   **Inflationary:** Commodities $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Yields $\uparrow$ $\implies$ USD $\downarrow$ (Historically) / USD $\uparrow$ (Modern Fed Reaction).
-   **Deflationary:** Commodities $\downarrow$ $\implies$ Yields $\downarrow$ $\implies$ Stocks $\uparrow$ (Cheap money).

### 3.2 Key Correlations (Forex Specific)
-   **USD vs Commodities:** Inverse. (Priced in Dollars).
-   **AUD/USD vs Gold:** Positive. (Australia is a major miner).
-   **USD/CAD vs Oil:** Inverse. (Canada is a Petro-currency. Oil Up $\to$ CAD Up $\to$ USDCAD Down).
-   **USD/JPY vs 10Y Yields:** Strong Positive. (Japan yields are pegged near 0. US Yields rising widens the spread).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Bond Yield Divergence
-   **Scenario:** USD/JPY makes a New High.
-   **Intermarket Signal:** US 10-Year Yield ($US10Y$) fails to make a new high.
-   **Diagnosis:** The driver of the USD rally (Yields) is fading. The move is hollow.
-   **Trade:** Short USD/JPY.

### 4.2 Risk On / Risk Off (RORO)
-   **Risk On:** Stocks $\uparrow$, Yields $\uparrow$, AUD/JPY $\uparrow$, Gold $\downarrow$.
-   **Risk Off:** Stocks $\downarrow$, Yields $\downarrow$ (Flight to safety), AUD/JPY $\downarrow$, Gold $\uparrow$.
*Rule:* Never buy AUD/JPY if the S&P 500 is crashing.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Oil Link):**
WTI Crude Oil crashes 5% in one day.
How do you trade EUR/CAD?
Analysis: Oil Crash $\to$ CAD Weakness.
EUR is neutral.
Trade: **Long EUR/CAD**.

**Exercise 2 (The Gold Link):**
Gold breaks out to All-Time Highs.
What does this imply for the US Dollar? (Weakness / Inflation).
How do you trade AUD/USD? (Long).

**Exercise 3 (Lag):**
Bond markets are "Smarter" than Stock markets.
If Bonds start rallying (Yields dropping) while Stocks are at ATH, what is the warning? (Recession imminent).
