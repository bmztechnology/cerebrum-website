# PropTech and Tokenization of Real Assets

## I. Executive Summary

**PropTech** applies technology to the built world. **Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization** brings real estate on-chain, promising **Fractionalization**, **Instant Settlement**, and **Global Liquidity**. However, the microstructure clash is between the **Permissionless nature of DeFi** and the **Highly Regulated/Physical nature of Real Estate** (Property Rights, Evictions, KYC).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The SPV Wrapper)
House $\to$ LLC (SPV).
LLC Shares $\to$ Tokenized (ERC-20).
Purchasing the Token = Purchasing share of LLC = Indirect ownership of House.
The "Link" is legal, not digital.
If LLC manager goes rogue, the Token is worthless paper.
Trust is moved, not removed.

### Definition 2.2 (Automated Market Maker for Real Estate)
Lofty / RealT.
Users trade house tokens on Uniswap?
Liquidity issue: AMM requires high volume. Houses trade infrequently.
Solution: Empirical Valuation Oracle updates price?
Or Order Book?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Illiquidity Premium Paradox
Real Estate returns are high *because* it is illiquid.
If you make it liquid (Tokenize), does the return drop to match Bonds?
Or does the "Liquidity Premium" add value?
Likely: Value rises (Liquidity Premium), Yield compresses.

### 3.2 Composability
Use Tokenized House as collateral in Aave to borrow USDC.
"Real Estate backed Stablecoins."
Bridging the \$300 Trillion real estate market into the \$1 Trillion crypto market.
Massive collateral injection.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 iBuying (Opendoor)
Algorithmic Market Maker for Houses.
Algo estimates price. Offers Cash.
Inventory risk (Holding the house).
Failed when volatility exceeded algo tolerance (Zillow Offers).
Microstructure lesson: Market Making illiquid assets requires massive spreads.

### 4.2 Home Equity Agreements (HEAs)
Tokenizing the *Equity* not the debt.
Owner sells 10% of future appreciation for cash today.
Unlocking "Dead Capital."
Institutional investors buy the tokens as a "Housing Index" bet.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Eviction Smart Contract?):**
Tenant pays rent to Contract.
If rent late, Contract changes lock code?
"Smart Locks."
Physical enforcement of digital logic.
Legal/Ethical boundaries.

**Exercise 2 (Title on Chain):**
Currently Title Insurance is a tax on uncertainty of archaic records.
If Land Registry is on Blockchain.
Title is perfect.
Insurance vanishes. Frictionless transfer.
Govt resistance is the blocker.
