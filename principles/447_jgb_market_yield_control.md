# JGB Market Yield Control: The Widowmaker

## I. Executive Summary

**Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs)** operate under a unique regime of **Yield Curve Control (YCC)** (2016-2024?). The Bank of Japan (BoJ) pegs the 10Y yield (e.g., at 0% or 0.5%) by unlimited buying (Fixed Rate Operations). This suppresses volatility and kills market liquidity. Shorting JGBs is called the **Widowmaker** trade because the BoJ has unlimited ammunition to squeeze shorts.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Peg)
"10Y Yield will not exceed 0.50%."
If Market Yield hits 0.50%, BoJ buys infinite amount.
Price floor established.
Distorts the curve (Kink at 10Y).

### Definition 2.2 (Rinban Operations)
Scheduled BoJ purchases across the curve.
Like QE, but targeting price, not quantity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Monetization
BoJ owns > 50% of JGB market.
Government pays interest to BoJ. BoJ returns profit to Government.
"Debt service is cancelled out."
Effective monetization of deficit.
Risk: Currency collapse (JPY).

### 3.2 The Trade-off
To defend the Peg (Yield Cap), BoJ must print Yen.
If global rates rise, pressure on Peg increases.
Printing Yen devalues Currency.
Policy Trilemma: Cannot control Yields AND Exchange Rate given free capital flow.
BoJ sacrificed Yen to save JGBs.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Buying the Swap Spread
JGB Yield = 0.5% (Capped).
Swap Rate (uncontrolled) = 0.8%.
Spread widens.
Trade: Pay Fixed JPY Swap / Buy JGB.

### 4.2 The Exit
When YCC ends.
Yields spike.
Banks holding JGBs suffer MTM losses.
Value of Yen should rally?
Massive repricing of global risk (JGBs are the anchor of low rates globally).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Liquidity Vacuum):**
Days where 10Y JGB volume is zero.
BoJ is the only buyer. No sellers.
"Dead Market."

**Exercise 2 (Home Bias):**
90% of JGBs held domestically (Banks, Post Finance, Insurance).
Loyal captive base.
Harder for foreign hedge funds to break the peg compared to ERM (Soros).
