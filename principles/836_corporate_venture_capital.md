# Corporate Venture Capital CVC

## I. Executive Summary

**Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)** is the investment arm of a large corporation (Google Ventures, Intel Capital). Unlike traditional VC (Financial Return only), CVC seeks **Strategic Return** (Window on technology, M&A pipeline, Ecosystem building). Microstructure conflict ensues involves **Signaling Risk** (If Intel passes on the Series B, is the startup dead?) and **Right of First Refusal**.

## II. Formal Definitions

**Strategic:** "Does this help our core business?" (Salesforce investing in AppExchange apps).
**Financial:** "Will this IPO?" (GV investing in Uber).
Balance Sheet investing vs Dedicated Fund structure.
Compensation: CVC managers acts largely salary (No Carry?), leading to talent selection issues.

### Definition 2.2 (The "Touch of Death")
Competitor signaling.
If Exxon invests in a clean-tech startup.
Does it block the startup from working with Shell?
Yes.
Startups must be wary of taking CVC money too early.
Limit CVC to < 20% of round.
