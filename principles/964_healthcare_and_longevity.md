# Healthcare and Longevity

## I. Executive Summary

Healthcare is the largest sector of the economy (20% of US GDP). It is inefficient, opaque, and data-poor. **Longevity Science** (CRISPR, Senolytics) promises to extend lifespans, transforming **Demographics** and **Pension Liability** models. The synthesis argues that "Health" is the ultimate asset, and the transition from **Sick Care** to **Health Span Extension** is the mega-trend.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Longevity Escape Velocity)
When science adds > 1 year of life expectancy for every year that passes.
immortality?
Economic impact: Retirement age becomes obsolete.
Career span 40 years $\to$ 80 years.
Compound interest runs longer (Buffett effect).

### Definition 2.2 (Value-Based Care)
Fee-for-Service: Doctor paid significantly to treat sick patient. (Incentive: More sickness).
Value-Based: Doctor paid to keep patient healthy. (Incentive: Prevention).
Alignment problem.
HMOs (Kaiser) use Value-Based.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Bio-Platform Thesis
Moderna is not a drug company; it's a software company (mRNA code).
Biology becoming Engineering.
Faster iteration loops.
"Tech Multiple" valuations applied to Biotech.
Volatility is binary (FDA approval).

### 3.2 The Obesity Cure (GLP-1)
Ozempic/Wegovy.
Structurally reduces calories.
Short Fast Food? Short Dialysis? Long Airlines (Less fuel)?
Second-order effects of a healthier population.
GDP boost (Productivity).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Longevity Derivatives
Bonds linked to survival rates.
Pension funds buy "Longevity Swaps" to hedge people living too long.
Insurers sell them.
Trading the mortality curve.

### 4.2 Data Monetization
23andMe.
Genetic data is valuable for drug discovery.
Privacy issues.
Tokenized Genomes (DAO) where users sell their own data to Pharma.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Cost of Cure):**
Gene therapy (Zolgensma) costs \$2M.
Cures blindness.
How to pay?
"Mortgage for Health"?
Financial engineering required for medical engineering.

**Exercise 2 (Aging as a Disease):**
FDA does not recognize Aging as a disease.
Cannot trial drugs for "Aging."
Regulatory bottleneck.
Lobbying to change definition $\implies$ Boom in longevity drugs.
