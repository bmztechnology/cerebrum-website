# Modern Monetary Theory (MMT): The New Paradigm

## I. Executive Summary

**MMT** challenges the orthodox view that governments must tax before they spend. It posits that a government issuing its own fiat currency simply credits bank accounts to spend (creating money) and taxes to destroy money (controlling inflation). Solvency is impossible; the only constraint is **Real Resource Availability** (Inflation).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Sectoral Balances)
$$(S - I) + (T - G) + (M - X) = 0$$
-   Private Sector Balance ($S-I$).
-   Public Sector Balance ($T-G$).
-   Foreign Sector Balance ($M-X$).
Algebraic Identity: For the Private Sector to Net Save ($S>I$), the Government MUST run a Deficit ($G>T$) (assuming balanced trade).
Govt Surplus $\implies$ Private Sector Deficit.

### Definition 2.2 (The Job Guarantee)
MMT Proposal: Gov acts as Employer of Last Resort.
Guarantees a job at minimum wage.
This acts as an Automatic Stabilizer.
Recession $\to$ JG payroll expands (Stimulus).
Boom $\to$ JG payroll shrinks (Labor moves to private sector).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Taxes Drive Money
Why do you accept useless paper (Dollars)?
Because you need them to pay taxes to stay out of jail.
Taxes create demand for the currency.
Taxes also "cool down" the economy by removing purchasing power.

### 3.2 The Deficit Myth
"Borrowing from China?" No.
Selling Treasuries is just a "Reserve Drain."
It swaps non-interest bearing Reserves (Checking Account) for interest-bearing Bonds (Savings Account).
It is a monetary operation, not a funding requirement.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Inflation is the Limit
If Gov spends when Factories are full + Unemployment is 0%.
Result: Bidding war for resources $\implies$ Inflation.
MMT accepts this. "Spending is limited by Inflation, not Revenue."

### 4.2 Trading Reaction
If a country adopts MMT explicitly (e.g., Green New Deal funded by printing):
Long Stocks (Nominal Revenue pumps).
Short Bonds (Yields must rise unless YCC).
Short Currency (Debasement).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Clinton Surplus):**
In late 90s, US Gov ran a Surplus.
Private Sector was forced into Deficit (Debt exploded).
Result: Pot Com Bubble $\to$ Crash.
MMT argues persistent surpluses are destabilizing.

**Exercise 2 (Hyperinflation?):**
Weimar/Zimbabwe printed money.
Result: Hyperinflation.
MMT says: They printed money *while supply capacity was destroyed* (War).
Printing money when factories are idle (2009, 2020) does not cause inflation.
