# Covered Bonds Europe: Dual Recourse

## I. Executive Summary

**Covered Bonds** are debt instruments issued by banks that are secured by a **Cover Pool** of high-quality assets (Mortgages/Public Sector Loans). Crucially, the assets remain **On Balance Sheet** (no SPV transfer in the same sense as ABS), and investors have **Dual Recourse**: Claim on the Issuer (Bank) AND a preferential claim on the Cover Pool. This makes them extremely safe (AAA), typically yielding just above Sovereigns.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Dual Recourse)
1.  **Issuer Default:** Investor ranks pari-passu with senior unsecured creditors? No, usually Cover Pool is segregated.
2.  If Bank fails, Cover Pool is ring-fenced to pay Covered Bonds.
3.  If Cover Pool assumes loss, Investor has claim on Bank's remaining assets.
"Belts and Braces."

### Definition 2.2 (The Cover Pool)
Dynamic. Bank must replenish non-performing assets.
Overcollateralization (e.g., 105%) mandated by law (Pfandbrief Act).
Strict eligibility (LTV limits).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Comparison to RMBS
RMBS: "Off Balance Sheet." Risk transfer. Investor relies *only* on the pool.
Covered Bond: "On Balance Sheet." Cheapest funding source. Investor relies on *Bank + Pool*.
European standard (huge market). US prefers Agency MBS/GLs.

### 3.2 Asset Encumbrance
Issuing Covered Bonds ties up the best assets.
Depositors and Unsecured Creditors are left with worse assets.
"Bail-in" regulations limit the % of encumbrance allowed.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
Covered Bonds are High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) Level 1 or 2A.
Banks buy each other's Covered Bonds for Treasury management.
Central Bank collateral eligible (ECB buys heavily).

### 4.2 Duration Matching
Pool is Long Term Mortgages (Fixed or Float).
Bond is Fixed Term (Bullet).
Asset-Liability Mismatch risk remains with the Bank (Issuer).
Bank uses Swaps to hedge.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Pass-Through?):**
Covered Bonds are bullets (Soft Bullet).
If Issuer fails, bond might extend 1 year?
But usually not Pass-Through like MBS.
Predictable cashflows.

**Exercise 2 (Pfandbrief Spread):**
Yield vs Bunds.
Spread reflects liquidity and bank credit (residual).
During Euro crisis, Peripheral Covered Bonds widened, but much less than Senior Unsecured.
