# Eurozone Doom Loop: Values vs Solvency

## I. Executive Summary

The **Eurozone** suffers from a structural flaw: Member states issue debt in a currency they do not control. This creates a **Sovereign-Bank Doom Loop**. If Italy's Sovereigns fall in value, Italian Banks (who hold the bonds) lose capital. Banks stop lending, causing Recession. Recession increases Sovereign Deficit. Cycle repeats. The ECB's OMT and TPI tools are desperate attempts to hold this fragile architecture together.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Target2 Imbalances)
Payment system of Eurosystem.
Capital Flight from Italy $\to$ Germany.
Bundesbank owns claim on ECB. ECB owns claim on Bank of Italy.
Target2 Balances measure intr-eurozone capital flight.
Germany Target2 Surplus: +€1 Trillion. Italy Deficit: -€600B.
Unsettled debt.

### Definition 2.2 (Redenomination Risk)
Risk that a country exits Euro and returns to Lira/Peseta.
Market prices this into spreads (BTP-Bund Spread).
"Whatever it takes" (Draghi 2012) was essentially a promise to remove Redenomination Risk via ECB printing.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Optimal Currency Area (Mundell)
Eurozone is NOT optimal.
1.  Labor Mobility? Low (Language barriers).
2.  Fiscal Transfer Union? No (Germans won't pay for Greeks).
3.  Synchronized Cycles? No.
Result: Divergence.
One Interest Rate fits none. Too low for Germany (Inflation), too high for Italy (Stagnation).

### 3.2 The Doom Loop Mechanism
Banks hold domestic sovereign bonds (Zero Risk Weight reg).
Home Bias.
Bond Yield Spike $\to$ Bank Equity Crash $\to$ Bailout required $\to$ Sovereign Debt rises.
Feedback loop.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shorting the Spread
Long German Bunds / Short Italian BTPs.
The "Widowmaker of Europe."
ECB manipulates the BTP yield (PEPP/TPI) to kill short sellers.
"Don't fight the ECB."

### 4.2 The "Hamiltonian Moment"
COVID Recovery Fund (NextGenEU).
Joint debt issuance.
First step towards Fiscal Union (United States of Europe).
Bullish for Euro survival long term.
Bearish for German taxpayers.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Greece 2015):**
Syrizagovt threatened default.
ECB threated to cut ELA (Emergency Liquidity) to Greek Banks.
ECB forced Greece to surrender.
Central Bank used liquidity as a political weapon.

**Exercise 2 (Switzerland Cap):**
SNB capped EUR/CHF to stop Swiss appreciation (Euro flight).
Peg broke in 2015.
 CHF +20% in minutes.
Euro instability exports volatility to neighbors.
