# Sleep and Trading Performance

## I. Executive Summary

**Sleep Deprivation** mimics the effects of alcohol intoxication on cognitive performance. For traders, lack of sleep impairs the **Prefrontal Cortex** (Risk control) and sensitizes the **Amygdala** (Fear/Anger). The "macho" culture of 4-hour sleep nights is a recipe for **Alpha Decay**. Sleep is the primary recovery mechanism for **Metabolic Clearance** of neurotoxins generated during intense focus.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Sleep-Risk Correlation)
Mullainathan.
1 hour less sleep $\implies$ Risk aversion increases (Fear)? OR Risk seeking (Impulsivity)?
Reality: Incoherent risk taking.
Volatility of decisions increases.
"Fat Finger" errors increase.

### Definition 2.2 (REM Sleep and Pattern Recognition)
REM sleep integrates memory.
"Sleeping on the problem."
The brain processes the day's charts and finds hidden patterns during REM.
No REM $\implies$ No learning from yesterday's market.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Circadian Rhythms
Chronotypes.
Larks (Morning) vs Owls (Night).
Markets open at 9:30 AM.
Larks outperform Owls in the morning session.
Owls should trade the close or Asian session.
Trading against your chronotype is a handicap.

### 3.2 The Monday Effect
Stock returns are lower/volatility higher on Mondays?
"Daylight Savings Time" shift (loss of 1 hour sleep) causes Market crash probability to spike on the following Monday.
Kamstra (2000).
Biological lag impacts global pricing.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sleep Hygiene as Edge
Jeff Bezos: "I sleep 8 hours to make 3 good decisions a day."
Trader logic: "If I sleep, I miss the London open."
Reframing: Sleep is *position sizing* for the brain.
Well-rested brain = High Sharpe Ratio.

### 4.2 Naps
NASA study.
20-minute nap improves performance 34%.
"Power Naps" during the lunch lull (12:00-1:00 PM).
Resetting the Adenosine levels.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Sleep Journal):**
Track hours slept vs Daily PnL.
Usually a strong positive correlation.
Data-driven proof that "Grinding" is counter-productive.

**Exercise 2 (Blue Light Blocking):**
Screens (Blue light) suppress Melatonin.
Traders stare at screens until bedtime.
Result: Insomnia.
Action: Blue light glasses after 8 PM. preserve the recovery cycle.
