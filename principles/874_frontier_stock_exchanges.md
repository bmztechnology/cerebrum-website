# Frontier Stock Exchanges Liquidity Traps

## I. Executive Summary

**Frontier Markets** (Vietnam, Nigeria, Bangladesh) are pre-Emerging markets. They offer high growth potential but suffer from **Liquidity Traps**. Stocks may trade days without volume. The microstructure is defined by **Foreign Ownership Limits (FOL)**, **Floor/Ceiling limits** (preventing price discovery), and **Manual Settlement** processes.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Liquidity Trap)
You enter a position easily (small size).
You engage in "Price Discovery" (Stock doubles).
You try to exit.
No buyers.
Sale impacts price by -50%.
"Roach Motel: You can check in, but you can't check out."

### Definition 2.2 (Foreign Ownership Limit - FOL)
Vietnam: Foreigners can own max 49% of Bank.
Once limit reached, "Foreign Room" = 0.
Foreigners must trade with each other.
Two Prices:
1. Local Price.
2. Foreign Price (Local + Premium).
Spread represents the scarcity of access.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 MSDC (Morgan Stanley Capital International) Reclassification
Frontier $\to$ Emerging.
Passive Flows (ETF) trigger massive buying.
"Front Running the Upgrade."
Qatar/UAE upgrade (2014).
Conversely: Downgrade (Argentina). Forced selling.
The Index Provider creates the liquidity event.

### 3.2 The Floor Price Rule
Bangladesh/Pakistan.
Market crashes. Regulator sets "Floor Price" (Yesterday's close).
"Cannot sell below X."
Result: Volume $\to$ 0.
Nobody buys at X because fair value is X - 20%.
Market freezes for months.
Artificial stability creates zombie market.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Participating Notes (P-Notes)
Bank (JPM) buys Indian stock.
Issues "P-Note" (Derivative) to Hedge Fund offshore.
Hedge Fund gets exposure without registering with regulator.
Anonymity.
Often premium priced.

### 4.2 Dividend Repatriation Risk
Nigeria.
Foreign Airlines/Investors have \$Bn stuck.
Central Bank refuses to convert Naira to USD.
"Trapped Cash."
Valuation must discount for "Probability of Exit."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Vietnam ETF):**
VNM ETF.
Trades in NY.
Holds illiquid Vietnamese stocks.
If US investors panic sell VNM.
ETF acts as price discovery mechanism while local market is asleep or frozen?
Basis risk between ETF and NAV.

**Exercise 2 (Safaricom):**
Kenya Stock Exchange.
Safaricom = 60% of Index.
Market is highly concentrated.
Buying "The Market" = Buying one company.
Lack of breadth.
