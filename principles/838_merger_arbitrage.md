# Merger Arbitrage Risk Arbitrage

## I. Executive Summary

**Merger Arbitrage** involves trading the spread between the **Announced Deal Price** and the **Current Market Price**. It is essentially selling insurance against **Deal Failure** (Regulatory blocking, Financing failure). Microstructure relies on assessing **Antitrust Risk** (FTC/DOJ) and the **Definitive Agreement** terms. It typically exhibits **Negative Skew** (Small steady profits, massive occasional loss).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Spread)
Bidder A offers \$100 for Target B.
Target B trades at \$95.
Spread = \$5.
Return = \$5 / \$95 = 5.2%.
Annualized Return depends on Time to Close (Duration).
If deal breaks, B falls to \$70 (Pre-deal price).
Risk/Reward: Make \$5 or Lose \$25. Win rate must be > 85%.

### Definition 2.2 (Cash vs Stock Deal)
**Cash:** Buy Target. Risk is deal break.
**Stock:** Bidder offers 1.5 shares of A for B.
Strategy: Buy B, Short 1.5 A. (Lock in the spread).
Removes market risk of A.
Pure bet on the merger completing.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Antitrust Regimes
Khan Regime (FTC).
"Vertical Integration" challenges (Microsoft / Activision).
Spread reflects Regulatory Uncertainty.
"Hard" deals trade at 20% spreads. "Soft" deals at 2%.
Lina Khan Put: Spreads are structurally wider now.

### 3.2 Bidding Wars
Hostile offer. White Knights.
Target trades *above* deal price (\$102).
Market expects a higher bid.
"Bumpitrage."
Activist investors (Elliott) buying stakes to force a bump.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Downside Protection
Put Options.
Buying deep OTM puts on the Target.
If deal breaks, Puts explode.
Cost of Puts reduces yield.
"Hedged Arb."

### 4.2 The Deal Corridor
Trading the volatility *during* the pending phase.
News leak "DOJ to sue." Stock drops.
Arb desk analyzes legal merit. "It's a weak suit."
Buy the dip.
Legal Alpha.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Twitter vs Musk):**
Musk signed binding merger agreement.
Tried to walk away.
Twitter sued to force specific performance.
Arbs bought at \$30. Deal at \$54.20.
Courts favor contract sanctity. Massive Arb pay day.

**Exercise 2 (Termination Fees):**
If Bidder walks, they pay Breakup Fee (3%).
If Regulator blocks, Reverse Termination Fee (RTF).
RTF compensates Target for damage.
Arb calculation must include the RTF floor.
