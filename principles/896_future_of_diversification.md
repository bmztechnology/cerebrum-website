# The Future of Diversification

## I. Executive Summary

The **60/40 Portfolio** died in 2022 (Correlations went to 1). The future of diversification lies in **Uncorrelated Alternative Betas** and **Real Assets**. The synthesis of Volume 9 suggests a portfolio constructed of **Risk Factors** (Growth, Inflation, Liquidity, Geopolitics) rather than Asset Classes. The "Dragon Portfolio" or "Cockroach Portfolio" aims for survival in a volatile century.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Correlation Breakdown)
Bonds hedge Stocks only when Inflation is low.
When Inflation is high, Bonds and Stocks fall together (2022).
Need assets that go UP when Stocks/Bonds go DOWN.
Commodities, Managed Futures (Trend), Long Volatility.

### Definition 2.2 (The Dragon Portfolio)
Artemis Capital (Chris Cole).
Assets:
1. Secular Growth (Stocks).
2. Income (Real Estate/Credit).
3. Inflation Hedge (Gold/Commodities).
4. Long Volatility (Options/Tail Risk).
The "Long Vol" bucket is the missing piece in most portfolios.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Financial Repression
Govt Debt / GDP > 100%.
Cannot default. Cannot pay real interest.
Solution: Inflation > Interest Rates. (Negative Real Rates).
Transfers wealth from Savers (Bonds) to Debtors (Govt).
Investor Defense: Real Assets (Scarce collateral).

### 3.2 The Illiquidity Barbell
Hold extremely liquid assets (Cash/T-Bills) AND extremely illiquid assets (VC/Farmland).
Avoid the middle (Corporate Bonds, Mutual Funds) where liquidity liquidity is fake.
Barbell structure handles shocks better.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Tokenized Diversification
Using Blockchain to access fractionalized Farmland, Art, Uranium.
Hyper-diversification.
Wallet holds 500 asset types.
Rebalancing via Smart Contract.
Portfolio Theory automated.

### 4.2 Personal Alpha
Human Capital as an asset.
In a world of AI deflation, "Human" skills (Empathy, Judgment) become scarce.
investing in one's own adaptability.
The ultimate hedge against obsolescence.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Backtesting the 2020s):**
Run 60/40 vs Dragon Portfolio through 1970s (Inflation).
Dragon wins.
Volume 9 argues we are entering a 1970s-like or 1940s-like era.
regime change requires portfolio change.

**Exercise 2 (The Final Exam):**
Review all 100 chapters of Volume 9.
Common thread: **Structure matters more than price.**
Understanding the Microstructure (The rules of the game) allows extracting the Alpha.
