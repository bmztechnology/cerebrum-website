# Decentralized Identity and Reputation

## I. Executive Summary

**Decentralized Identity (DID)** and **Reputation Systems** (Soulbound Tokens) are the missing layer of Web3. They enable **Under-collateralized Lending** (Credit Scores on-chain) and **Sybil Resistance** (Proof of Humanity). Microstructure implication: Moving from "Trustless" (Over-collateralized) to "Trust-Minimized" (Reputation at stake) capital efficiency.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Soulbound Token - SBT)
Non-Transferable NFT.
Issued by Authority (University, Employer, Credit Protocol).
"Alice has completed Course X."
"Bob has defaulted 0 times."
Builds a persistent Identity graph.

### Definition 2.2 (Verifiable Credentials - VC)
W3C Standard.
User seeks attestation from Issuer.
Issuer gives signed VC.
User presents VC to Verifier (dApp).
Zero Knowledge: User proves "I am over 18" without revealing DOB.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Sybil Resistance
Gitcoin Grants (Quadratic Funding).
Problem: 1 person creates 100 accounts to vote.
Solution: Passport (DID).
Connect Twitter, Facebook, BrightID.
Score > 20 $\implies$ Human.
Microstructure of Democracy.

### 3.2 The Credit Score Oracle
Spectral / Cred Protocol.
Analyzes wallet history (Liquidation history, Age, Balance).
Assigns Score.
Credit efficiency:
Score 800 $\implies$ LTV 120%? (Under-collateralized).
Score 500 $\implies$ LTV 80%.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 AirDrop Farming Defense
Projects want to airdrop to real users, not bots.
Criteria: "Must have ENS name" or "Gitcoin Passport."
Microstructure: A market for "Aged Wallets."
Black market for "Reputable Identities."

### 4.2 Lens Protocol (Social Graph)
Owning your social graph.
If Twitter bans you, you lose followers.
On Lens, you own the "Follow" NFT.
Portability of Reputation.
Reduces platform lock-in.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Rugged Identity):**
Influencer pumps and dumps.
Reputation tracked on-chain?
"ZachXBT" verification.
If Identity is permanent $\implies$ Accountability increases.
Game Theory: Repeated Games (Reputation) encourage cooperation.
Anonymous Games encourage defection.

**Exercise 2 (ZK KYC):**
Prove "I am not from North Korea" without revealing "I am Alice."
Compliance without surveillance.
 The Holy Grail for Institutional DeFi.
