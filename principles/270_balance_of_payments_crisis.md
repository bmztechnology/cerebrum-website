# Balance of Payments Crisis: The Sudden Stop

## I. Executive Summary

A **Balance of Payments (BOP) Crisis** occurs when a country cannot pay for its essential imports or service its external debt. It necessitates a sharp adjustment of the Current Account (Trade Balance) usually via **Currency Devaluation** (Making imports expensive) and **Austerity** (Crushing demand). It is the macro-equivalent of a household bankruptcy.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (BOP Identity)
$$CA + KA + \Delta R = 0$$
-   $CA$: Current Account (Trade + Income).
-   $KA$: Capital Account (FDI + Portfolio Flows).
-   $\Delta R$: Change in Reserves.
Crisis: $KA$ turns negative (Capital Flight). $R$ goes to zero (Reserves Empty).
Result: $CA$ *must* turn positive immediately.
Imports must stop.

### Definition 2.2 (Currency Defense)
Central Bank sells Reserves to buy Local Currency.
Raises Interest Rates to 50% to tempt Capital back.
If Reserves = 0, Game Over.
Float the currency.
Currency overshoot (falls 50%).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 J-Curve Effect (Revisited)
Devaluation helps $CA$ eventually.
But initially, Import Prices rise while Volumes remain fixed.
$CA$ gets WORSE before getting better.
The "Valley of Tears."
Requires IMF Bridge Loan to survive these 6-12 months.

### 3.2 Absorbtion Approach
$Y - A = CA$.
Output ($Y$) - Domestic Absorbtion ($C+I+G$) = Current Account.
To fix Deficit ($CA<0$):
Either Increase $Y$ (Hard in short term).
Or Decrease $A$ (Cut Spending - Austerity).
BOP Crisis always ends in lesser consumption.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 LatAm Crisis 1980s
"La Decada Perdida."
Import Substitution Industrialization + Debt.
Volcker Shock spiked rates.
Mexico Default 1982.
10 years of depression.
Asset Prices: Stocks down 90% in USD terms.

### 4.2 Sri Lanka 2022
Running Twin Deficits.
Tax Cuts + Organic Farming ban (Crop failure).
Tourism collapsed (COVID).
Reserves hit 0.
No Fuel. No Medicine.
President fled.
Classic BOP Crisis.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Soros Reflexivity):**
As reserves fall, confidence falls.
Capital flight accelerates.
Reserves fall faster.
Self-reinforcing loop.
Crisis happens "Gradually, then Suddenly" (Hemingway).

**Exercise 2 (Import Cover):**
Rule of Thumb: Need 3 months of Import Cover in Reserves.
If Reserves < 3 months imports $\implies$ Panic zone.
Pakistan hovered at 3 weeks in 2023.
