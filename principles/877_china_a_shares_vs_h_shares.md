# China A Shares vs H Shares

## I. Executive Summary

Chinese companies trade on two main markets: **A-Shares** (Mainland: Shanghai/Shenzhen, Denominated in CNY, mostly Retail) and **H-Shares** (Hong Kong, Denominated in HKD, Institutional/Foreign). The **AH Premium Index** tracks the price divergence. Typically, A-Shares trade at a significant premium to H-Shares due to **Capital Controls** preventing arbitrage.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The AH Premium)
$$ Premium = \frac{Price_A (in HKD)}{Price_H (in HKD)} - 1 $$
Historically A > H by 30-40%.
Why?
1. A-Share investors (Chinese Retail) have limited investment options (Cannot buy US stocks). Capital trapped $\implies$ Asset inflation.
2. H-Share investors (Global) have alternatives. Valuation disciplined by global peers.

### Definition 2.2 (Stock Connect)
Link between HK and Shanghai/Shenzhen.
Northbound: Foreigners buy A-Shares.
Southbound: Chinese buy H-Shares.
Softens the barrier, but Daily Quotas and distinct clearing rules prevent full arbitrage.
Premium narrows but persists.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Dual Listing Microstructure
Same voting rights. Same dividends.
Different price.
Violation of One Price Law.
Caused by Segmented Markets + Inconvertible Currency.
If CNY becomes fully convertible, Premium should $\to$ 0.

### 3.2 The "National Team"
Chinese State Funds buy A-Shares to stabilize market during crashes.
Less intervention in H-Shares.
Creates a "Put Option" in A-Shares.
Justifies the premium? Lower volatility due to state support.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Convergence Trade
Long H / Short A.
Betting on premium collapse.
Widowmaker trade.
Premium can expand to 100% (2015 Bubble).
Cost of carry on Short A-Shares is high (borrow diffcult).

### 4.2 Index Inclusion
MSCI inclusion of A-Shares (at 20% weight).
Forces Global Passive funds to buy A-Shares.
Inflow of institutional capital.
Professionalization of A-Share market.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Dividend Yield Arb):**
Issuer pays 1 CNY dividend.
A-Share Price 100 CNY. Yield 1%.
H-Share Price 60 CNY ($\approx$ 65 HKD). Yield 1.6%.
Value investor prefers H-Share.
Momentum investor prefers A-Share (Casino dynamics).

**Exercise 2 (Technological Divergence):**
A-Shares dominated by Liquor (Moutai) and Banks.
H-Shares dominated by Tech (Tencent/Meituan).
Different index composition driving divergence in performance?
AH Premium Index controls for this by using only dual-listed stocks.
