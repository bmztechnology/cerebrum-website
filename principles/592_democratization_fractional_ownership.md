# Democratization Fractional Ownership

## I. Executive Summary

**Democratization** enables retail investors to access asset classes previously reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Through **Fractional Ownership** (Slice), platforms allow investment in **High-End Art** (Masterworks), **Classic Cars** (Rally Rd), **Farmland** (AcreTrader), and **Private Equity** (Moonfare). This lowers the minimum ticket size from \$1M to \$50, unlocking "The Alts Allocation" for the masses.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Regulation A+)
JOBS Act provision.
"Mini-IPO."
Allows raising up to \$75M from *non-accredited* investors.
The legal wrapper for most fractional platforms.
LLC created for each asset (e.g., "Andy Warhol Painting #1 LLC"). Investor buys shares in LLC.

### Definition 2.2 (Secondary Market)
Liquidity is the challenge.
Platforms build internal Bulletin Boards (ATS - Alternative Trading Systems).
Trading windows (monthly/quarterly).
Liquidity is lower than NYSE, but greater than holding physical art.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Liquidity Premium Inversion
Usually, illiquidity implies higher return (Discount).
Here, Retail pays a *Premium* for access.
Listing price often includes "Sourcing Fee" (10% mark up).
Asset trades at Valuation > Auction Price?
"Passion Premium."

### 3.2 Modern Portfolio Theory (Retail Edition)
Adding 5% Art and 5% Farmland to a \$50k portfolio.
True diversification.
Reduction of Sharpe Ratio volatility.
Or just scratching a gambling itch?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Collectibles as an Asset Class
Sneakers (StockX), Baseball Cards, Watches.
Low correlation to S&P 500.
Driven by cultural trends / hype.
High volatility.

### 4.2 Real Estate Crowdfunding
Buying a brick in a rental property.
Receive share of rental income (Yield).
Receive share of appreciation.
"REITs vs Direct Fractional." (Fractional allows specific asset selection).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fees):**
Management Fee (1%) + Carry (20%).
On a painting?
Cost drag is significant.
Asset must appreciate 15% to net 10%.

**Exercise 2 (Selection Bias):**
Do platforms offer the best assets?
Or the ones they can't sell to rich people?
"Adverse Selection" risk again.
