# Event Driven and Distressed Debt

## I. Executive Summary

**Event Driven** strategies capitalize on corporate events: **Spinoffs**, **Bankruptcies**, **Restructurings**, and **Litigation**. **Distressed Debt** (Vulture Investing) involves buying the bonds of bankrupt companies to convert them into Equity during the reorganization (Chapter 11). Microstructure requires deep understanding of **Legal Process**, **Capital Structure Priority**, and **Vote Buying**.
