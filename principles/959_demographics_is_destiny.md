# Demographics is Destiny

## I. Executive Summary

**Demographics** allows predicting the economy 20 years in advance (People born today enter workforce in 20 years). The world is facing a **Depopulation Bomb** (Fertility < 2.1). This leads to **Labor Shortages**, **Pension Insolubility**, and a shift from **Growth to Maintenance**. The synthesis argues that Demographics is the primary driver of Interest Rates and Inflation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Dependency Ratio)
(Young + Old) / Working Age.
Global ratio is rising (Aging).
Less workers supporting more retirees.
Tax burden on workers increases.
Productivity must increase (AI/Robots) to offset this, or Standard of Living falls.

### Definition 2.2 (The Demographic Dividend)
When Birth rates drop, you have few kids and many workers.
Goldilocks period (China 1990-2015).
Explosive growth.
Dividend turns into "Demographic Drag" when those workers retire.
China is now hitting the "Lewis Turning Point."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Life Cycle Hypothesis (Modigliani)
Young: Borrow (School/House).
Middle: Save (Stocks/Bonds).
Old: Dissave (Sell Assets to pay for care).
If Boomers sell assets to Millenials, and Millenials are a smaller cohort (or poorer).
Asset Prices must fall?
"The Great Sell-Off" thesis.

### 3.2 Gerontocracy Economics
Voters are old.
Policy favors old (Pensions/Healthcare protected).
Policy taxes young.
Result: Youth innovation stifled?
Japanification.
Low dynamism.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long Healthcare / Short Toys?
Sector rotation based on age.
Nursing Homes, Biotech, Cruises.
Vs
Baby formula, Toys, Schools.
Geography matters: Long Africa (Young), Short Europe (Old)?
But Africa lacks Capital. Europe has Capital.
Capital flows to Labor? Or Labor migrates to Capital?

### 4.2 Automation Theta
Long Robotics is a demographic hedge.
If no one exists to flip burgers, the Robot *must* be bought.
Inelastic demand for automation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (South Korea):**
Fertility rate 0.7.
Mathematical extinction.
Housing market collapse?
Or do they fix it with mass immigration/AI?
The "Canary in the Coal Mine" for the world.

**Exercise 2 (Pension Crisis):**
Defined Benefit schemes assume 7% returns + steady ratio of workers.
Both assumptions broken.
Solvency crisis.
Bailouts or Benefit Cuts?
