# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The Business Dashboard

## I. Executive Summary

Trading is a business, and like any business, it requires objective metrics to judge performance. Focusing solely on "Net Profit" is dangerous; a trader can make money while taking ruinous risks. KPIs allow the trader to diagnose the *quality* of the revenue stream, identifying leaks in execution, discipline, or edge before they become solvency crises.

## II. The Core Metrics

### 2.1 The Sharpe Ratio
Risk-Adjusted Return.
$$Sharpe = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$$
-   $R_p$: Portfolio Return.
-   $R_f$: Risk-Free Rate (e.g., US T-Bill 5%).
-   $\sigma_p$: Std Dev of Returns.
*Benchmark:* Sharpe > 1.0 is Good. Sharpe > 2.0 is Institutional. Sharpe > 3.0 is Suspicious (Ponzi/Curve Fit).

### 2.2 The Sortino Ratio
Similar to Sharpe, but only penalizes **Downside Deviation**.
$$Sortino = \frac{R_p - R_T}{\sigma_d}$$
Upside volatility (Making money fast) is not "Risk."
*Utility:* Superior for aggressive strategies where huge wins skew the standard deviation.

### 2.3 The Calmar Ratio
Return vs Drawdown.
$$Calmar = \frac{CAGR}{MaxDrawdown}$$
*Benchmark:* A Calmar of 2.0 means you make 2x your max drawdown annually. (e.g., Make 40% with 20% DD).

## III. Execution Metrics

### 3.1 SQN (System Quality Number) (Van Tharp)
$$SQN = \sqrt{N} \times \frac{Expectancy}{StdDev}$$
-   $SQN < 2$: Hard to trade.
-   $SQN > 3$: Excellent.
-   $SQN > 7$: Holy Grail.

### 3.2 Efficiency Ratio (Execution)
$$EntryEff = \frac{MFE}{MFE + MAE}$$
Measures picking tops/bottoms.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Sharpe Calculation):**
Trader A makes 20%. Volatility 10%. (Sharpe $\approx 2$).
Trader B makes 40%. Volatility 40%. (Sharpe $\approx 1$).
Investor prefers A. Why? (Smoothness allows for Leverage. Lever A 2x $\to$ 40% return with 20% vol, beating B).

**Exercise 2 (Maximum Drawdown Duration):**
It's not just *how deep* the drawdown went, but *how long* it lasted.
If you are underwater for 365 days, will your LPs (or wife) fire you?

**Exercise 3 (Diagnosis):**
High Win Rate, Low Sharpe.
Diagnosis? (You are taking small wins but huge losses. "Eating like a bird, pooping like an elephant").
