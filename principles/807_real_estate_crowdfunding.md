# Real Estate Crowdfunding and Syndication

## I. Executive Summary

**Crowdfunding** and **Syndication** democratize access to commercial real estate deals previously reserved for High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI). Platforms (Fundrise, CrowdStreet) aggregate small checks (\$1k-\$50k) into a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to buy assets. This introduces **Retail Liquidity** into private markets but raises issues of **Adverse Selection** (Do the best deals go to the crowd, or the leftovers?).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Syndication Structure)
**Sponsor (GP):** Finds deal, signs loan, manages asset.
**Investors (LP):** Passive capital.
**Fees:** Acquisition Fee (1-2%), Asset Management Fee (1-2% of Revenue), Promote (See Chapter 806).
SEC Reg D (506c): Allows general solicitation to Accredited Investors.
SEC Reg A+: "Mini-IPO" for non-accredited (Fundrise).

### Definition 2.2 (The Platform Microstructure)
Platform acts as Broker-Dealer (or marketplace).
Due Diligence layer?
If Platform allows *any* deal $\implies$ Craigslist model.
If Platform curates deals $\implies$ Reputation risk.
**Pre-Funding:** Platform buys deal, then sells to crowd? (Balance sheet risk).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Adverse Selection in Syndication
Why is the sponsor raising from 100 dentists online instead of 1 institutional partner (Blackstone)?
a. Deal is too small for Blackstone. (Valid).
b. Deal is too risky for Blackstone. (Danger).
c. Sponsor wants weak control (Crowd doesn't vote). (Agency risk).

### 3.2 Liquidity Mismatch
Real Estate: 5-10 year hold.
Retail Investor: Needs cash for wedding next year.
Secondary Markets (bulletin boards) are thin.
"Gated Funds" (Redemptions limited to 5% per quarter) like BREIT.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 eREITs vs Syndicates
**eREIT (Fundrise):** Blind Pool. Diversified. Liquid(ish). Beta play.
**Syndicate (CrowdStreet):** Specific Asset. Concentrated. Illiquid. Alpha play.
Portfolio construction: Core in eREIT, Satellite in Syndicates.

### 4.2 The Promote Drag
Heavy fees in syndication reduce IRR by 300-500 bps.
Gross Return 18% $\to$ Net Return 13%.
Is the Manager alpha worth the drag?
Direct Indexing for Real Estate? (Tokenization hopes to solve this).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Capital Call):**
Roof leaks. reserve empty.
Sponsor issues Capital Call.
Retail investors ignore email or have no cash.
Dilution? Legal battles?
Syndicates are fragile to distress.

**Exercise 2 (Marketing Alpha):**
Sponsors with better YouTube channels raise more money.
Capital allocation by charisma, not competence.
Due Diligence is critical. Track record verification.
