# Global Linkers Gilts OATs: RPI vs CPI

## I. Executive Summary

The Inflation-Linked market is global ("Linkers"). The UK **Index-Linked Gilts** market is the oldest and uses **RPI** (Retail Prices Index). France issues **OATi** (French CPI) and **OAT€i** (Euro Area HICP). Differences in index construction (Arithmetic vs Geometric mean) create structural wedges between markets. Pension demand drives Real Yields in UK to extremely low levels (often -2% to -3%).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (RPI vs CPI Wedge)
UK RPI uses Carli Formula (Arithmetic Mean).
CPI uses Geometric Mean.
RPI consistently prints 1% higher than CPI.
"The Wedge."
UK Linkers pay RPI. Pricing includes the wedge.
Reform proposed (RPI-CPI alignment) caused market crash (Holders generate less return).

### Definition 2.2 (OAT€i)
Euro Area Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) ex-Tobacco.
Benchmark for Eurozone inflation expectations.
Used by German/Italian investors (who lack large domestic linker markets).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The LDI Crisis (UK 2022)
UK Pension Funds hold massive Linker positions (Assets) to match Liabilities (indexed to RPI).
Leveraged LDI strategies.
Gilts crashed (Yields spiked). Margin calls.
Fire sale of Linkers.
BoE intervention saved the market.
Highlighted the concentration of Linkers in LDI hands.

### 3.2 Breakeven Cross-Market
US 10Y BEI vs UK 10Y BEI.
UK usually higher (Structural RPI wedge + Import dependence?).
Relative Value trade.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Euro Switching
Trade OATi (France) vs OAT€i (Euro).
Betting on French Inflation differential vs Germany/Euro.
Driven by local wages, energy mix (Nuclear vs Gas).

### 4.2 Duration convexity
UK Linkers have exceedingly long duration (50 Years).
Convexity is massive.
Small yield change $\implies$ Huge price change.
Wildest bond instrument in DMs.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Super-Longs):**
UK issued 2068 Linker.
Who buys?
Pension fund with 50 year liability (20 year old employee).
Cashflow matching.

**Exercise 2 (Carry Trade):**
Buy US TIPS / Sell UK Linkers.
Bet on US Inflation > UK Inflation (adjusted for Wedge).
Or Real Rate convergence.
