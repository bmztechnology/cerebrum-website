# Fairness and Reciprocity in Markets

## I. Executive Summary

Standard economics assumes selfishness. **Reciprocity** (answering kindness with kindness, and hostility with hostility) is a fundamental human trait that governs non-anonymous interactions. In markets, **Fairness** constrains profit-seeking; firms that violate fairness norms (Price gouging during disasters) suffer reputational punishment that exceeds the short-term profit.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Positive vs Negative Reciprocity)
**Positive:** Gift Exchange. Employer pays above market wage $\implies$ Employee works harder (Efficiency Wage Theory).
**Negative:** Altruistic Punishment. Punishing a cheater even at a cost to oneself.
Ultimatum Game rejections.

### Definition 2.2 (Reference Transaction)
Kahneman, Knetsch, Thaler.
A transaction is "fair" if it adheres to the reference price/profit.
If costs rise, raising price is Fair (Protecting profit).
If demand rises, raising price is Unfair (Exploiting power).
Explains sticky prices / lack of surge pricing in retail.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Trust and Contracts
Contracts are incomplete.
Trust (Reciprocity) fills the gaps.
"Handshake Deal."
Litigious societies (Low Trust) have high transaction costs.
Markets require a baseline of fairness to function (or liquidity leaves).

### 3.2 Inequity Aversion
Fehr & Schmidt $U(x)$.
Humans dislike advantageous inequity (Guilt) and disadvantageous inequity (Envy).
Explains support for redistribution and taxes.
In Corporate Governance: CEO Pay Ratios. High ratios lower morale/productivity.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Price Gouging
Uber Surge Pricing.
Economically efficient (Clears supply/demand).
Psychologically "Unfair."
Uber capped surge during emergencies after backlash.
Fairness constrains the invisible hand.

### 4.2 Customer Loyalty
Loyalty is reciprocal.
"We treat you well, you stay."
Breach of fairness (Hidden fees) destroys loyalty instantly.
"Junk Fees" regulation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Tipping Norm):**
Why tip a waiter you will never see again?
Social Norm of Fairness.
Self-image ("I am a good person").
Economic irrationality?

**Exercise 2 (Wage Stickiness):**
Why not cut wages in recession?
Unfair. Destroys reciprocity.
Firms fire people instead (Layoffs are viewed as "Business necessity," wage cuts as "Insult").
