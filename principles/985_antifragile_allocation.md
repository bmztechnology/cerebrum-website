# Antifragile Allocation

## I. Executive Summary

**Antifragility** (Taleb) describes things that gain from disorder. Fragile things break (Porcelain). Robust things resist (Steel). Antifragile things grow (Muscle/Hydra). An **Antifragile Portfolio** is constructed to **Benefit from Chaos**. It combines **Barbell Allocation**, **Tail Hedging**, and **Optionality** to ensure that Black Swans are profitable events.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Concave vs Convex)
Fragile = Concave Payoff. (Limited upside, unlimited downside).
Examples: Turkey before Thanksgiving. Banking system. Selling Puts.
Antifragile = Convex Payoff. (Limited downside, unlimited upside).
Examples: Startups. Buying Puts. Trend Following.
Master Strategy: Remove all concave exposures. Load up on convex ones.

### Definition 2.2 (The Via Negativa)
Addition by Subtraction.
Make portfolio better by removing the fragile.
Remove: Leverage, Short Gamma Strategies, Trusted Third Parties (Counterparty Risk).
Result: What remains is robust or antifragile.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Barbell (Revisited)
Constraint: Capital Preservation.
Put 90% in T-Bills (Hyper-Robust).
Put 10% in High Risk/High Reward (Hyper-Antifragile).
If 10% goes to 0, you lose 10% (Limited).
If 10% goes 100x, you double wealth.
Better than 100% in "Medium Risk" (Stocks) which can drop 50%.

### 3.2 Optionality as Strategy
"Tinkering."
Small bets.
Trial and error.
In trading: Buying many cheap out-of-the-money options.
Most expire worthless (Small cost).
One hits big (Jackpot).
Mimics Evolution.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Venture Capital
The asset class of antifragility.
100 investments.
90 fail.
1 is Google.
Returns the fund.
Requires Power Law handling.

### 4.2 Crypto Self-Custody
Fragile: Crypto on FTX (Counterparty risk).
Antifragile: Crypto in Cold Storage (Self-sovereign).
Chaos in banking system $\implies$ Value of self-custody goes up.
The ultimate hedge against institutional failure.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Turkey Problem):**
Turkey is fed every day.
Confirms hypothesis "Human loves me" for 1000 days.
Day 1001 (Thanksgiving): Shock.
Fragile systems look stable (Low Vol) right before the crash.
Beware "Steady Returns" (Madoff/Yield Farming).

**Exercise 2 (Stress Testing):**
Ask: "What happens if market drops 50%?"
Fragile: Margin call. Ruin.
Robust: Down 50%. Hold.
Antifragile: Portfolio Up (Hedges) + Dry Powder to buy.
Goal: Be the buyer of last resort.
