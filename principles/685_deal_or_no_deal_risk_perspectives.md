# Deal or No Deal Risk Perspectives

## I. Executive Summary

The TV show **Deal or No Deal** serves as a high-stakes **Natural Experiment** in decision making under risk. It tests **Risk Aversion**, **Path Dependence**, and **Reference Points**. Data from 30+ countries confirms Prospect Theory: Contestants become **Risk Seeking** after bad luck (trying to break even) and **Risk Averse** after good luck (protecting the gain).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Banker's Offer)
Banker offers $EV \times RiskDiscount$.
Contestant decision to accept depends on current wealth in the cases.
And *previous* offers.
If Offer drops from \$100k to \$50k (bad luck), \$50k is rejected (Reference point was \$100k).
If Offer rises from \$10k to \$50k (good luck), \$50k is accepted.
History matters.

### Definition 2.2 (The Break-Even Effect on TV)
Post et al (2008).
"Losers" (opened big cases early) reject fair offers to gamble for the last remaining big case.
"Winners" settle early.
The "Peanuts Effect": If potential winnings are tiny, risk seeking increases (Boredom/Fun).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Dynamic Utility
Utility is not defined over Wealth levels ($W$).
It is defined over Canges in Wealth ($\Delta W$).
The reference point updates dynamically during the game.
Slow updating = "Sticky Reference Point."

### 3.2 Regret Minimization
Fear of "Looking Stupid" on TV.
Fear of selling the \$1M case for \$10k.
"The Switch" decision (Monty Hall problem variant).
Social pressure influences risk tolerance.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Settlement Negotiation
Litigation.
Accepting a settlement vs going to trial.
Similar to Deal or No Deal.
Risk Aversion drives settlements.
Plaintiff (Gain frame) settles. Defendant (Loss frame) takes risks?

### 4.2 Portfolio Liquidation
You have a portfolio of illiquid assets.
You receive a "Block Bid" (The Banker's Offer).
Do you take the discount for liquidity?
Or hold to maturity (Open the cases)?
Depends on distress level (Path dependence).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Crowd):**
Audience yells "No Deal!"
They bear no risk. They want entertainment (Variance).
Agency problem: Advisors (Bonus based on volume) vs Client (Wealth preservation).

**Exercise 2 (Probability Weighting):**
Contestants treat 1% chance of \$1M as significant.
Lottery preferences.
The Banker exploits this skew.
