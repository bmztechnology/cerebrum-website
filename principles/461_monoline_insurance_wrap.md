# Monoline Insurance Wrap: The Guarantee

## I. Executive Summary

**Monoline Insurers** (MBIA, AMBAC, AGM, BAM) guarantee the timely payment of Principal and Interest on Muni bonds. In exchange for a premium, the bond carries the Insurer's Rating (usually AA or AAA). Before 2008, 50% of Munis were insured. After Monolines collapsed (due to exposure to Subprime CDOs), the market shifted to **Underlying Ratings**, though "Bond Insurance 2.0" (AGM/BAM) has revived for lower-rated issuers.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Wrap)
Bond has two ratings:
1.  Underlying (e.g., BBB).
2.  Insured (e.g., AA).
Trades at the AA yield (plus small liquidity premium).
If Insurer downgrades, Bond price drops (Blow out).

### Definition 2.2 (Claims Paying Resources)
Insurer holds capital cushion.
Leverage: Total Par Insured / Capital.
Safe leverage $\approx 100:1$?
If defaults spike, capital is wiped out.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The 2008 Collapse
Monolines strayed from Munis (Safe) to Structured Finance (Toxic).
Wrapped CDOs.
Losses exceeded capital.
Ratings cut to Junk.
The "Wrap" lost all value.
Municipal market functioned on "Naked" credit analysis for first time in decades.

### 3.2 Mutuals vs Public
-   **AGM (Assured Guaranty):** Public company. Profit motive.
-   **BAM (Build America Mutual):** Mutual company owned by policyholders (the issuers). Conservative. Only insures essential Munis.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Credit Enhancement Arbitrage
Issuer (BBB) yield = 5%.
Insured (AA) yield = 3.5%.
Insurance Premium = 0.5% (PV).
Net Cost = 4.0%.
Savings = 1.0%.
Arbitrage exists if Market Spread > Insurance Premium.

### 4.2 Surveillance
Insurer monitors the credit for 30 years.
Intervenes/Sues if Issuer misbehaves.
"Detective on the case."
Value add for passive retail investors.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Puerto Rico):**
Monolines had huge exposure.
Fought aggressively in restructuring (PROMESA).
Settlements involved huge payouts.
Proved the value of insurance (Bondholders got paid, Insurers took the hit).

**Exercise 2 (Shadow Rating):**
Smart investors look at the Underlying rating.
"Don't buy a Junk bond just because it has a Wrap."
Wrap is catastrophe insurance, not a substitute for credit quality.
