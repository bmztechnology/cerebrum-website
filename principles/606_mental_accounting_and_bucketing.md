# Mental Accounting and Bucketing

## I. Executive Summary

**Mental Accounting** (Thaler) is the tendency to code, categorize, and evaluate economic outcomes in separate "buckets" rather than as a fungible whole. Money is Money, but people treat **"House Money"** (Casino winnings) differently from **"Hard Earned Cash."** In portfolios, this leads to irrational layering (e.g., holding high-interest debt while holding low-interest savings).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Fungibility Violation)
Principle: \$1 in Account A = \$1 in Account B.
Behavior:
Account A (Savings): 0.1% yield.
Account B (Credit Card): 20% APR.
Rational: Pay off B with A.
Mental Accounting: "A is for Safety / Vacation. I can't touch it."

### Definition 2.2 (House Money Effect)
Risk taking increases after a prior gain.
"It's not my money, it's the market's."
Encourages speculation in bubbles.
Conversely: **Break-Even Effect** (Taking risk to get back to 0).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Dividend Preference
"Spending the interest, never touching the principal."
Total Return (Price + Div) is what matters.
But people separate them.
Spending \$100 dividend feels safe. Selling \$100 of shares feels like "Eating the corn seed."
Explains preference for High Dividend Stocks.

### 3.2 Goal Based Investing (GBI)
Institutionalizing Mental Accounting.
Bucket 1: Safety (Cash/Bonds) for liability hedging.
Bucket 2: Market (Index) for growth.
Bucket 3: Aspirational (Moonshots).
Mathematically sub-optimal (Efficiency loss), but Behaviorally optimal (Stops panic selling).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Rebate Check
Government stimulus checks.
If labeled "Rebate", people spend.
If labeled "Bonus", people treat as windfall.
Naming matters.

### 4.2 Portfolio Construction
Core-Satellite approach.
"Core" satisfies the safety bucket.
"Satellite" satisfies the gambling urge.
Keeps the gambling contained (5% limit).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Lost Ticket):**
Scenario A: Lost \$20 bill. Do you buy \$20 theater ticket? (Yes).
Scenario B: Lost \$20 theater ticket. Do you buy another? (No).
Why? "Entertainment Budget" account is depleted in B, not in A.
Economic impact is identical (-\$20).

**Exercise 2 (Paper Loss vs Realized Loss):**
"I haven't lost until I sell."
Mental account is open.
Closing it solidifies the pain.
Avoiding realization updates the mental ledger.
