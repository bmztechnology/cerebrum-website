# Social Proof Consensus Trades

## I. Executive Summary

**Social Proof** (Cialdini) states that "we view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it." In finance, this creates **Consensus Trades**. When the entire sell-side (Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan) recommends "Long Emerging Markets," Social Proof makes it psychologically difficult to bet against them, even if fundamentals disagree.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Consensus Estimate)
Mean of all analyst estimates.
Behavioral anchor.
Deviation from consensus creates risk.
"Herding around the mean."
Analysts are incentivized to be wrong together rather than wrong alone.

### Definition 2.2 (Crowded Trades)
When social proof maximizes, position sizing maximizes.
Result: Asymmetry.
If Consensus is right: Small gain (Priced in).
If Consensus is wrong: Massive crash (everyone exits at once).
The "Pain Trade."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Asch Conformity Experiments
Subjects identified line length incorrectly to conform with the group.
30% conformity rate.
In investment committees, junior analysts withhold dissenting views to conform with the CIO.
Groupthink.

### 3.2 Valid Social Proof
Wisdom of Crowds (Surowiecki).
Aggregating diverse, independent opinions leads to accuracy.
Social Proof fails when opinions are *not* independent (correlated error).
Market bubbles are failures of independence.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sentiment Analysis
Using social media volume (StockTwits, Reddit) as a proxy for Social Proof.
High buzz $\implies$ High Crowding.
Short Term: Momentum.
Long Term: Reversal signal.

### 4.2 The "Anti-Portfolio"
Constructing a portfolio of "Hated" assets.
Tobacco, Oil (in 2020), Coal.
Lack of social proof means low valuation (High FCF Yield).
"Social Stigma" alpha.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Dinner Party Indicator):**
Peter Lynch.
If everyone at a party is talking about stocks $\implies$ Top.
If everyone changes subject when you mention stocks $\implies$ Bottom.
Anecdata of social saturation.

**Exercise 2 (ETF Flows):**
Massive inflows into "Thematic ETFs" (e.g., ARK).
Lagging indicator of social proof.
Often marks the local top.
