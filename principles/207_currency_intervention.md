# Currency Intervention: Fighting the Market

## I. Executive Summary

**Currency Intervention** is when a Central Bank buys or sells its own currency in the Forex market to influence the exchange rate. It is usually a battle against "speculators" (George Soros). Unless the intervention is coordinated (Plaza Accord) or supported by monetary policy change, it usually fails in the long run against the massive $7T/day Forex flow.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Mechanism)
Goal: Strengthen JPY (Weaken USD/JPY).
MOF (Ministry of Finance) orders BOJ to Sell USD reserves and Buy JPY.
Impact: Supply of USD $\uparrow$, Demand for JPY $\uparrow$. Price of USD/JPY $\downarrow$.

### Definition 2.2 (Sterilization)
-   **Unsterilized:** Selling USD for JPY shrinks the JPY money supply. (Tightens Rates).
-   **Sterilized:** BOJ Sells USD for JPY, then *buys* JGBs (Injects JPY back).
Sterilization neutralizes the monetary impact.
Most interventions are Sterilized (to avoid crashing the domestic stock market).
*Sterilized intervention is notoriously ineffective.*

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Impossible Trinity
You cannot have:
1.  Free Capital Flow.
2.  Fixed Exchange Rate.
3.  Independent Monetary Policy.
Intervention is an attempt to fight this trilemma.
Usually, the PEG breaks (Soros vs Bank of England 1992).

### 3.2 Reserve Adequacy
How many bullets do you have?
Metric: Import Cover (Months of imports).
Metric: Reserves / Short Term External Debt.
If Ratio < 1, the country is vulnerable to a speculative run (Asian Financial Crisis 1997).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 "Smoothening" vs "Reversing"
Central Banks successfully *smooth* volatility. "Leaning against the wind."
They rarely *reverse* a fundamental trend.
Strategy: Fade the intervention spike.
If USD/JPY drops 300 pips on Intervention, but Yield Spread is still wide $\implies$ Buy the dip.

### 4.2 The Swiss Peg (EUR/CHF)
SNB pegged EUR/CHF at 1.20 for years.
Printed infinite CHF to buy EUR.
Balance sheet exploded.
2015: SNB gave up. "Frankenshock." CHF rallied 30% in 1 minute.
Lesson: Pegs work until they explode. Never short volatility on a Peg.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Signal):**
"Rate Check."
Central Bank calls major dealers asking for quotes.
This is a warning shot. "We are watching."
Traders usually close shorts nervously.
Actual intervention follows if rate check is ignored.

**Exercise 2 (Coordination):**
Plaza Accord (1985).
US, UK, Germany, France, Japan agreed to devalue USD.
Worked perfectly because *everyone* sold USD.
Unilateral intervention (Japan alone) is weak.
