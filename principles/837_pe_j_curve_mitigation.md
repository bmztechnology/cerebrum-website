# The Private Equity J-Curve Mitigation

## I. Executive Summary

The **J-Curve** describes the cash flow profile of Private Equity: Deep negative flows (Capital Calls + Fees) in early years, followed by positive flows (Exits) in later years. Investors face the **Liquidity Valley of Death**. Mitigation strategies include **Credit Facilities** (Subscription Lines) to delay capital calls, **Co-Investments**, and **Secondaries**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Subscription Line of Credit)
Fund gets a bank loan secured by LP commitments.
GP uses Loan to buy Deal.
Calls Capital from LPs 180 days later to pay off Loan.
Effect 1: LP IRR increases (Money deployed for shorter time).
Effect 2: LP risk increases (Leverage on Leverage).
Effect 3: Smoother cash flows.

### Definition 2.2 (The IRR Illusion)
Using Sub Lines boosts IRR but *not* MOIC (Multiple of Invested Capital).
IRR is time-sensitive.
MOIC is cash-on-cash.
LPs must scrutinize "Levered IRR" vs "Unlevered IRR."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Over-commitment Strategy
Pensions know 20% of committed capital will never be called (Dry powder).
And distributions will offset calls eventually.
They commit 120% of target allocation.
Risk: "The Perfect Storm" (2008). No distributions. All calls. Denominator effect.
Liquidity crunch.

### 3.2 Time Diversification
Vintage Years.
Investing consistently in 2020, 2021, 2022.
Avoids "Market Timing" risk.
Blends the J-Curves.
A mature PE program has a flat cash flow profile (Distributions pay for Calls).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Co-Investments to Fill the J
Fee-free Co-Invest gets money to work immediately.
No "Blind Pool" drag.
Instant exposure.
J-Curve flattener.
Requires in-house team capability.

### 4.2 NAV Loans
Fund is fully invested. Needs cash to support portfolio.
Takes loan against the NAV of the portfolio.
"Cross-collateralized leverage."
Controversial.
Used to pay distributions? (Ponzi dynamics?).
Or to save a struggling asset?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Standardized IRR calc):**
SEC focus.
Must disclose IRR *with* and *without* Sub Line.
Transparency on the engineering.

**Exercise 2 (The Revolving Door):**
Distributions received $\to$ Re-commit to new fund.
Compound interest machine.
Self-sustaining endowment model (Yale).
