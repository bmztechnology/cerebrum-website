# Phillips Curve Mechanics: Theoretical Trade-offs

## I. Executive Summary

The **Phillips Curve** describes the inverse relationship between **Unemployment** and **Inflation**. The theory: To reduce unemployment, you must stimulate demand, which causes inflation. To kill inflation, you must cause unemployment. While the relationship broke down in the 2010s ("Flat Phillips Curve"), it roared back in the 2020s. Central Banks use this model to set the "Sacrifice Ratio" (How many jobs must die to kill 1% inflation?).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Traditional Curve)
$$\pi_t = \pi^e - \alpha(u_t - u_n) + v_t$$
-   $\pi_t$: Inflation.
-   $\pi^e$: Expected Inflation.
-   $u_t$: Unemployment Rate.
-   $u_n$: NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment).
-   $v_t$: Supply Shock (Oil).
If $u_t < u_n$ (Labor market tight), Inflation rises.

### Definition 2.2 (The Flat Curve)
2008-2019.
Unemployment fell to 3.5%, yet Inflation stayed low (<2%).
Slope $\alpha \approx 0$.
Why? Globalization (Importing cheap labor) + Weak Unions + Amazon Effect.
Fed assumed they could run economy hot without penalty.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 NAIRU Uncertainty
You cannot observe NAIRU. You can only estimate it.
Fed thought NAIRU was 5%. It was 4%.
Result: Policy mistakes.
Powell Pivot 2018: "We will stop hiking because we don't know where the stars are."

### 3.2 Non-Linearity
The Curve is likely a "J" shape.
Flat when Unemployment is high.
Vertical when Unemployment is extremely low (Capacity constraints).
We hit the vertical part in 2021.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Powell Put vs The Volcker Shock
If Curve is steep: Fed MUST hike aggressively to lower demand. Stocks Crash (Volcker).
If Curve is flat: Fed can cut rates without causing inflation. Stocks Rally (Powell 2019).
Current Regime: Steepening. Bad for assets.

### 4.2 Stagflation
Curve shifts OUTWARD.
High Unemployment AND High Inflation.
Worst of both worlds.
Caused by Supply Shocks ($v_t$ term dominates).
Phillips Curve fails to explain Supply Side inflation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (2021 Transitory Debate):**
Fed thought inflation was "Transitory" because they relied on a Flat Phillips Curve model.
They ignored the Supply Chain collapse.
Model Error = Policy Error.

**Exercise 2 (Wage Growth):**
Wage Growth Tracker (Atlanta Fed).
Lagging indicator.
If Wages rise 5%, Companies raise prices 5%.
Wage-Price Spiral validates the Phillips curve.
