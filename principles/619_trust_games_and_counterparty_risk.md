# Trust Games and Counterparty Risk

## I. Executive Summary

Finance is built on **Trust**. "Credit" comes from the Latin *Credere* (to believe). Behavioral Economics uses **Trust Games** (Game Theory) to model how trust is established and broken. In markets, trust is the invisible currency. When it evaporates (e.g., Lehman Weekend), liquidity vanishes, and **Counterparty Risk** becomes the only thing that matters.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trust Game)
Player A gets \$10. Can send $x$ to Player B.
Transfer is tripled ($3x$).
Player B can return $y$ to Player A.
Rational Nash Equilibrium: B keeps everything ($y=0$). Rational A sends nothing ($x=0$).
Actual Behavior: A sends money. B returns money.
Reciprocity drives markets.

### Definition 2.2 (Systemic Trust)
Trust in the Clearing House (CCP).
Trust in the Fiat Currency.
Trust in the Rule of Law.
When this breaks $\implies$ Hyperinflation / Bank Runs.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Reputation Collateral
Why do banks not default on trades?
Future value of business > One time gain from default.
Reputation is an asset.
In "End Game" scenarios (Bankruptcy), reputation value drops to zero. Paradoxical behavior emerges.

### 3.2 Contagion
Loss of trust is contagious.
"If Lehman failed, is Morgan Stanley safe?"
Informational asymmetry prevents verifying solvency.
Rational response is to pull liquidity from everyone.
Gridlock.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Crypto and "Trustless" Systems
Blockchain aims to replace "Social Trust" with "Cryptographic Proof."
"Don't Trust, Verify."
DeFi removes the Counterparty Risk (Smart Contract doesn't default).
But introduces Code Risk (Hacks).

### 4.2 Credit Analysis
More than balance sheet.
Management integrity.
"Character" is one of the 5 Cs of Credit.
Fraud detection (Enron) is detecting a breach of trust before the market does.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Ponzi Scheme):**
Exploits Affinity Trust (Bernie Madoff targeted Jewish country clubs).
Trust transferred via social network.
Due diligence bypassed because "My friend trusts him."

**Exercise 2 (Escrow):**
Mechanism to enforce trust between untrusted parties.
Cost of lack of trust = Escrow Fees.
High trust societies have lower transaction costs.
