# Ricardian Equivalence: The Neutrality Theorem

## I. Executive Summary

**Ricardian Equivalence** (Barro-Ricardo) is the controversial theorem stating that debt-financed government spending has **NO effect** on aggregate demand. Logic: Rational forward-looking consumers understand that borrowing today implies higher taxes tomorrow. Therefore, they save the stimulus check to pay the future tax. Public Dissaving is perfectly offset by Private Saving.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Intertemporal Budget Constraint)
$$G_1 + \frac{G_2}{1+r} = T_1 + \frac{T_2}{1+r}$$
Present Value of Spending = Present Value of Taxes.
If $G$ is constant, cutting $T_1$ (Deficit) requires raising $T_2$.
Consumer Wealth is unchanged.

### Definition 2.2 (Behavioral Response)
Assumption: Consumers care about their children (Intergenerational Altruism).
They leave the saved tax cut as a bequest to pay the future tax.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Why it Fails (Reality)
1.  **Myopia:** People don't look 50 years ahead. They spend now.
2.  **Liquidity Constraints:** Poor people *cannot* borrow. A tax cut gives them cash they spend immediately.
3.  **Finite Horizons:** "I'll be dead when the tax hike comes."
Empirically: Equivalence holds partially ($\approx 30-50\%$), not fully.

### 3.2 The Japan Case
Japan ran massive deficits.
Japanese Household Savings Rate rose initially.
Consistent with Ricardo.
People were scared of the future debt burden.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Effectiveness of Tax Rebates
2008 Bush Tax Rebate ($600).
Mostly saved (Ricardian).
2020 COVID Stimulus ($1200).
Mostly spent (Not Ricardian).
Why? Size and Urgency.
If Stimulus is perceived as "Temporary Windfall" vs "Permanent Income."

### 4.2 Bond Yields
If Ricardo holds:
Deficits don't raise Rates.
Private Savings rise to buy the new bonds automatically.
Supply meets Demand.
If Ricardo fails:
Deficits raise Rates (Crowding Out).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Test):**
Government cuts taxes.
Retail Sales flat. Savings Rate up.
Interpretation: Consumers expect higher taxes. Bearish signal long-term.

**Exercise 2 (Debt Irrelevance):**
Strict Ricardo implies Debt/GDP doesn't matter?
No, High Taxes cause deadweight loss (distortion).
Even if Demand is neutral, Supply side is hurt by high future taxes.
