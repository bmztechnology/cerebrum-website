# Scope 3 Emissions Data Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

**Scope 3 Emissions** (Supply Chain + Product Use) account for 90% of a company's carbon footprint but are the hardest to measure. The market is shifting from **Spend-Based Estimates** (Average carbon per dollar) to **Activity-Based Data** (Actual supplier data). This creates a massive data microstructure need: the **Carbon Ledger** where every invoice carries a carbon tag.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Scopes)
**Scope 1:** Direct Emissions (Burning gas in factory).
**Scope 2:** Indirect Electricity (Buying power).
**Scope 3 Upstream:** Suppliers (Steel, Chips).
**Scope 3 Downstream:** Customer Use (Gasoline in car, Electricity for iPhone).
Scope 3 is huge. Oil Company Scope 3 = 10x Scope 1+2.

### Definition 2.2 (Spend-Based vs Activity-Based)
**Spend-Based:** Buy \$1M steel. Average Steel intensity = 2kg/$ \implies$ 2M kg CO2.
Inaccurate. Incentivizes buying cheap (dirty) steel? No, incentivizes spending less.
**Activity-Based:** Supplier sends certificate: "This batch = 1.5kg/kg."
Incentivizes buying Green Steel.
Data availability gap.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Double Counting
My Scope 1 is your Scope 3.
If everyone sums Scope 3, global emissions > actual emissions.
For Portfolio Footprinting (Financed Emissions), this matters.
"WACI" (Weighted Average Carbon Intensity).
Attribution of the carbon value chain.

### 3.2 The Data Cascade
Walmart tells Suppliers: "Report Data or Lose Contract."
Suppliers tell *their* suppliers.
Bullwhip effect of data compliance.
Commoditization of carbon accounting software (Watershed/Persefoni).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
EU Tax on imports based on embedded carbon.
Requires Scope 3 data (Embedded emissions).
If data missing $\implies$ Default Penalty Value (High).
Forces global data standardization.
"The Brussels Effect."

### 4.2 Product Passport
QR Code on Shirt.
Shows Carbon footprint, Water usage, Factory location.
Compliance + Marketing.
Blockchain use case (Traceability).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Oil Major's Problem):**
Scope 3 Downstream = Cars burning gas.
How to reduce?
Sell less gas? (Business suicide).
Sell Carbon Capture?
Rebrand as "Energy Company" (Electrons have lower Scope 3).
Strategic pivot driven by Scope 3 exposure.

**Exercise 2 (Data Quality Score):**
PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials).
Data Score 1 (Audited) to 5 (Estimated).
Banks under pressure to improve portfolio data score.
Lending rate linked to data quality?
