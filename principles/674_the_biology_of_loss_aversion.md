# The Biology of Loss Aversion

## I. Executive Summary

Loss Aversion is not just a psychological concept; it is a **Biological Reality**. fMRI shows that the **Insula** (Pain) triggers more intensely for a loss than the **Striatum** (Pleasure) triggers for an equivalent gain. The ratio is roughly 2:1. This asymmetry is evolutionary: avoiding death (Loss) is more important than finding extra food (Gain). In markets, this ancient survival mechanism causes us to sell low (avoiding pain) and buy high (chasing pleasure).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Neural Loss Ratio)
Magnitude of Neural Firing (Loss $X$) $\approx 2 \times$ Neural Firing (Gain $X$).
This confirms Prospect Theory's $\lambda \approx 2.25$.
Loss Aversion is hard-wired, not learned.

### Definition 2.2 (Amygdala Lesions)
Shiv et al (2005).
Patients with Amygdala damage *do not* show Loss Aversion.
They behave deeper rationality (Maximizing EV).
Proof that "Emotion" is the source of the bias. To be perfectly rational, one must be biologically damaged?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Endowment Effect Biology
Why do we value what we own more?
Touching an object activates the somatosensory cortex and creates a "sense of ownership."
Selling it triggers the Insula (Pain of parting).
Online shopping (touchless) attempts to recreate this via "Try at home" (Warby Parker).

### 3.2 Pain of Paying
paying with Cash activates the Insula.
Paying with Credit Card does not (decouples consumption from payment).
" Casino Chips" in trading decouple money from reality.
"It's just points."
Reduces Loss Aversion... but encourages recklessness.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Reframing
To overcome Loss Aversion, reframe the Loss as a "Cost."
"Insurance Premium" vs "Loss."
"R&D Expense" vs "Failed Trade."
The Insula does not activate for "Costs" (Expected) as much as for "Losses" (Unexpected).

### 4.2 The 48-Hour Rule
Loss Aversion is strongest immediately.
It decays over time (Hedonic Adaptation).
If you want to sell a loser, wait 48 hours.
The pain subsides, rationality returns.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Cash Trading):**
Imagine if you had to physically hand over \$500 cash for every losing trade.
You would trade much less.
You would stop out much faster (to keep the remaining cash).
Digital abstraction hurts valid risk management.

**Exercise 2 (The Switch Test):**
"Would I buy this stock today?"
If No, selling is not a Loss, it is a Correction.
Bypassing the Endowment/Loss circuitry.
