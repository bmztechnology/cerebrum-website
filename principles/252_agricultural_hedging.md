# Agricultural Hedging: Feeding the Market

## I. Executive Summary

**Agricultural Commodities** (Corn, Wheat, Soybeans) are driven by **Seasonality**, Weather, and Geopolitics. Farmers use futures to hedge production (Selling Forward). Processors (Cargill, ADM) use futures to hedge input costs. The interaction creates the **Crush Spread** (Soybean Processing) and opportunities in **Basis Trading** (Cash vs Futures).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Crop Year)
-   Planting (Spring): Price reflects "Acreage Battle" (Corn vs Soy). Uncertainty High. Volatility High.
-   Pollination (Summer): Weather critical. "Rain makes Grain."
-   Harvest (Fall): Supply hits market. Low Prices (Seasonal Low).
-   Marketing (Winter): Basis strengthens.

### Definition 2.2 (The Crush Spread)
$$Crush = (Price_{Meal} \times 0.022 + Price_{Oil} \times 11) - Price_{Soybean}$$
Soybeans are crushed into Meal (Animal Feed) and Oil (Food/Biofuel).
If Crush Margin is high, Processors buy beans aggressively.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 WASDE Report
USDA "World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates."
The Bible of Ag trading.
Monthly.
Moves markets limit-up/limit-down.
Key metric: "Stocks-to-Use Ratio" (Inverse to Price).

### 3.2 Biofuel Mandates
RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard) mandates mixing Ethanol (Corn) and Biodiesel (Soy/Vegetable Oil) into fuel.
Links Food Prices to Oil Prices.
If Oil rises $\to$ Ethanol demand rises $\to$ Corn rises.
"Food vs Fuel" debate.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Basis Trading
Farmer sells cash grain at Local Elevator.
Price = Futures - Basis.
Elevator hedges by shorting Futures.
Elevator profits if Basis strengthens (Cash rises relative to Futures).
Infrastructure arb (Storage/Transport).

### 4.2 Fertilizer Correlation
Natural Gas is feedstock for Ammonia (Nitrogen).
Gas Price Spike $\to$ Fertilizer shortage $\to$ Lower Yields $\to$ Higher Food Prices.
Nitrogen stocks (CF Industries) are a derivative on the Corn/Gas spread.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Ukraine War 2022):**
Ukraine/Russia = "Breadbasket" (Wheat/Sunflower Oil).
Exports blocked.
Wheat Futures hit record highs.
Egypt (major importer) faced food riots.
Food Security is National Security.

**Exercise 2 (La Nina):**
Weather pattern causing drought in Argentina/Brazi (Soybean giants).
Supply shock.
North American farmers benefit.
Weather derivatives are the pure play.
