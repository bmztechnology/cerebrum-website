# Behavioral Game Theory

## I. Executive Summary

**Behavioral Game Theory** modifies standard Game Theory (Nash Equilibrium) by incorporating **Social Preferences** (Fairness), **Limited Strategic Thinking** (Level-k), and **Learning**. It explains why people cooperate in Prisoner's Dilemmas, reject money in Ultimatum Games, and fail to guess the "2/3 of the Average" correctly. It models **Actual Behavior**, not just optimal super-rationality.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Level-k Thinking)
Beauty Contest Game (Keynes). Guess number 0-100. Target = 2/3 of Average.
Level-0: Random (Avg 50).
Level-1: Assumes everyone is L0. Target = 33.
Level-2: Assumes everyone is L1. Target = 22.
Nash Equilibrium: 0.
Actual Winning Number: Typically 20-22 (Implies Level-2 thinking dominates).
Strategy: Be exactly one level deeper than the crowd, not infinite levels.

### Definition 2.2 (Quantal Response Equilibrium - QRE)
Players make mistakes (Noise).
Probability of choosing a strategy is proportional to its payoff (Logit).
Softens the harsh predictions of Nash.
Better fit for data.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Cooperation
Prisoner's Dilemma.
Nash: Defect/Defect.
Reality: Cooperate (Tit-for-Tat).
Driven by Altruism, Reciprocity, and Repeat Play (Shadow of the future).
Trust is an equilibrium selection mechanism.

### 3.2 Bubbles as Coordination Games
"I know it's a bubble (L2)."
"But I think others think it's real (L1)."
"So I will buy to sell to them (L3)."
Rational Bubbles require assumed irrationality in others.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Poker Strategy
Exploitative vs GTO (Game Theory Optimal).
GTO = Unexploitable (Nash).
Exploitative = Profiling opponent's behavioral flaws (Level-k) and adjusting.
Trading is an Exploitative Game (profiting from behavioral biases).

### 4.2 Central Bank Communication
Fed Signaling.
"if we raise rates, market thinks X."
"But market knows we know X."
Keynesian Beauty Contest of expectations.
Forward Guidance tries to anchor Level-k thinking.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Centipede Game):**
Pass pot to double it, opponent can steal.
Nash: Steal immediately.
Reality: Pass for a while (Trust/Risk), then steal.
Money left on the table by playing Nash.

**Exercise 2 (Rock Paper Scissors):**
Nash: 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 Random.
Humans: Win-Stay, Lose-Shift.
Exploitable patterns.
