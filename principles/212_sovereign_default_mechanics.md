# Sovereign Default Mechanics: The Hard Reset

## I. Executive Summary

Sovereigns don't go bankrupt; they **Default**. This involves halting interest payments and restructuring the debt. The process is a negotiation between the Sovereign and Creditors (Bondholders). Key concepts include **Haircuts** (Principal reduction), **Holdouts** (Vulture Funds), and **CACs** (Collective Action Clauses) designed to force minority creditors to accept the deal.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Types of Default)
-   **Technical Default:** Missed payment by mistake or temporary delay.
-   **Selective Default (SD):** Default on some bonds, pay others.
-   **Hard Default:** Repudiation. "We won't pay."

### Definition 2.2 (Restructuring Terms)
-   **Haircut:** Reduction in Face Value (e.g., Exchange $100 bond for $40 bond).
-   **Extension:** Lengthening maturity (Pay later).
-   **Coupon Reduction:** Lowering interest rate.
-   **NPV Reduction:** The total Present Value loss to the creditor.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Pari Passu (Equal Footing)
Legal clause: "All creditors must be treated equally."
Elliott Management (Paul Singer) used this to sue Argentina.
"If you pay the new bondholders, you must pay me (the Holdout) 100 cents on the dollar."
He seized an Argentinian Naval Ship in Ghana.
He won. Changed Sovereign Law forever.

### 3.2 Collective Action Clauses (CACs)
New bonds have CACs.
"If 75% of bondholders agree to a deal, the other 25% are forced to accept it."
Prevents Holdout/Vulture strategies.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Distressed Debt Investing
Buy Greek Bonds at $0.20.
Bet that EU Bailout will offer $0.40.
100% Return.
Requires deep legal analysis and political gambling.

### 4.2 Pre-Default Signs
1.  Yield > 10%.
2.  CDS > 1000bps.
3.  inverted Yield Curve (Short term rates explosive).
4.  IMF "Rescue Package" talks (IMF is Senior creditor, crowds out private bonds).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Russia 1998 vs 2022):**
1998: Defaulted on Domestic Debt (GKO). Devalued Ruble.
2022: Technical Default due to Sanctions (SWIFT blocked). Willing to pay, but unable.
Creditors still receive nothing.
Result: "Uninvestable" status.

**Exercise 2 (Recovery Rate):**
Historical Recovery Rate for Sovereigns is $\approx 50-60\%$.
Corporate Recovery Rate $\approx 40\%$.
Sovereigns usually want to return to markets, so they offer a somewhat decent deal.
