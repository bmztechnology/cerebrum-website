# Protectionism & Tariffs: The Trade War

## I. Executive Summary

**Protectionism** is the use of Tariffs, Quotas, and Subsidies to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. While politically popular ("Save our Steel"), economics dictates it creates a **Deadweight Loss**: Consumers pay more, Exporters lose markets (retaliation), and global efficiency drops. However, the **Infant Industry Argument** suggests temporary protection can build long-term capacity.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Tariff Diagram)
Supply/Demand graph.
World Price ($P_w$) is below Domestic Equilibrium ($P_eq$).
Imports = Dist ($Q_d$ - $Q_s$).
**Tariff ($t$):** Price rises to $P_w + t$.
1.  **Consumer Surplus:** Falls huge area (Bad).
2.  **Producer Surplus:** Rises small area (Good for protected firm).
3.  **Govt Revenue:** Imports $\times t$.
4.  **Deadweight Loss:** Triangles of lost efficiency.
Net Welfare effect is NEGATIVE.

### Definition 2.2 (Quota)
Quantity limit (e.g., "Max 1M tons of Sugar").
Worse than Tariff because Govt gets no revenue (unless it auctions licenses).
The "Quota Rent" goes to the Foreign Exporter (if they get the license).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Infant Industry (Hamilton/List)
Alexander Hamilton (USA) and Friedrich List (Germany) argued:
"Free Trade kicks away the ladder."
Rich countries used tariffs to build industry, then preached Free Trade once dominant.
Strategic Trade Policy: Protect Airbus until it can compete with Boeing.

### 3.2 Smoot-Hawley (1930)
US raised tariffs to 60%.
Global retaliation.
Global trade fell 66%.
Great Depression deepened.
Lesson: Trade Wars are negative-sum games.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Steel Tariffs (Section 232)
Trump 25% Steel Tariff.
US Steel producers (Nucor) rallied.
US Steel *Users* (Ford/GM/Caterpillar) suffered higher costs.
Job losses in Auto > Jobs gained in Steel.
Trade: Long Protected Sector / Short Downstream Users.

### 4.2 Inflationary Impact
Tariff = Consumption Tax.
10% Tariff on Chinese goods $\approx$ 0.5% added to CPI.
Central Bank dilemma: Hike rates to fight Tariff inflation? or Cut rates to fight Trade War growth shock?
Usually Hike (Stagflation risk).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Washing Machine Case):**
2018 Tariffs on Washing Machines (Samsung/LG).
Price of washers in US rose 12%.
Samsung moved factory to US (South Carolina).
Jobs created: 1800.
Cost per job to consumer: $815,000.
Economically inefficient, Politically successful.

**Exercise 2 (Non-Tariff Barriers):**
"Phytosanitary Standards."
EU bans Chlorine-washed Chicken (US).
Nominally for health.
Actually for protectionism (US chicken is cheaper).
Sneaky protectionism.
