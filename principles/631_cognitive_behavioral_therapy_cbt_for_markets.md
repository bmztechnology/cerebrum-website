# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT for Markets

## I. Executive Summary

**CBT** is the gold standard for treating anxiety/depression, based on the idea that **Thoughts determine Feelings**, which determine **Actions**. In trading, dysfunctional thoughts ("I must win this trade," "I am a loser") lead to destructive feeling (Anxiety, Shame) and actions (Overtrading). CBT techniques like **Cognitive Restructuring** help traders identify and debunk these "Cognitive Distortions."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The ABC Model)
**A (Activating Event):** Stopped out for a loss.
**B (Belief):** "I am stupid. I will never make it." (Irrational).
**C (Consequence):** Depression. Revenge trading.
Intervention point is B. Change Belief to: "Losses are part of the game. My edge works over time."

### Definition 2.2 (Cognitive Distortions)
**All-or-Nothing Thinking:** "If I don't make money today, I'm a failure."
**Catastrophizing:** "This loss will wipe me out."
**Personalization:** "The market comes after my stops." (Paranoia).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Unconditional Self-Acceptance
Performance = Worth?
If Self-Worth is tied to PnL, every drawdown is an existential crisis.
Healthy Trader: "I am a worthy person regardless of my PnL."
Detachment allows objectivity.

### 3.2 Exposure Therapy
Fear of pulling the trigger.
Systematic Desensitization.
Trade 1 share. Then 10 shares. Then 100.
Proving to the brain that "Nothing bad happens" (Safety learning).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Rational Debate
Journal technique.
Column 1: Automatic Negative Thought ("I can't take a loss").
Column 2: Rational Rebuttal ("Losses a cost of goods sold. Paul Tudor Jones takes losses.").
Win the debate on paper.

### 4.2 Worst Case Scenario
"What if I lose this trade?" -> "I lose 1%."
"Can I survive that?" -> "Yes."
"Then why am I sweating?"
Decatastrophizing.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Reframing):**
Old thought: "I lost money."
New thought: "I bought information."
Old thought: "I missed the move."
New thought: "I saved capital for the next opportunity."

**Exercise 2 (Worry Time):**
Schedule 15 mins at 5pm to worry.
If worry arises at 10am, say "Not now, I will worry at 5pm."
Partitioning anxiety.
