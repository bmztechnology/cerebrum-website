# Laddered Portfolio Construction: Structure

## I. Executive Summary

A **Bond Ladder** is a portfolio of bonds with staggered maturities (e.g., equal amounts maturing 1, 2, 3... 10 years from now). As each bond matures, the principal is reinvested at the long end of the ladder (e.g., in a new 10-year bond). This strategy reduces **Reinvestment Risk** and **Liquidity Risk**, providing a predictable income stream and average yield profile.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Rungs)
-   **Height:** Maturity (10 Years).
-   **Spacing:** 1 Year or 2 Years.
-   **Width:** Amount invested per rung.
Uniform Ladder: Equal notional in each rung.

### Definition 2.2 (Average Maturity)
A 1-10 Year ladder has an average maturity of 5.5 Years.
It mimics the performance of an intermediate bond fund, but with control.
Held to maturity: Principal is returned (Par). No realized losses from price fluctuation (unlike a fund).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Interest Rate Neutrality
-   **Rates Rose:** Bad for price of existing bonds. Good for reinvestment (The maturing rung buys a new 10Y at higher yield).
-   **Rates Fell:** Good for price. Bad for reinvestment.
Ladder averages the entry yields over a 10-year cycle.
"Dollar Cost Averaging" for interest rates.

### 3.2 Liquidity Profile
Cash comes due every year.
If you need cash, spend the maturing principal.
Avoids forced selling of long bonds during market drawdowns.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Bullet vs Ladder
Bullet (All 5Y) vs Ladder (1-10Y).
Same duration (~5Y).
Bullet needs to be rolled all at once. Market timing risk.
Ladder is process-driven. eliminates timing decisions.

### 4.2 Corporate Ladders
Risk: Calls.
If 10Y bond is Callable at 5Y.
Rates fall. Issuer calls bond.
You lose the high yield rung.
Must reinvest at low rates.
"Ladder truncation."
Solution: Buy Non-Callable bonds or Make-Whole Call bonds.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Steep Curve):**
Ladder captures roll down on *every* rung.
Each bond slides down the curve.
High total return.

**Exercise 2 (Inverted Curve):**
 Maturing bond (Short) yields 5%.
New bond (Long) yields 4%.
Reinvesting involves a yield cut.
Ladder acts as a drag?
Perhaps, but maintains the long-term discipline.
