# Sanctions Mechanisms: Weaponized Finance

## I. Executive Summary

**Sanctions** are the primary tool of modern economic warfare. They aim to isolate an adversary from the global financial system (Dollar Hegemony) and trade networks. Key mechanisms include **OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control)** enforcement, freezing Central Bank reserves, and **Secondary Sanctions**, which force neutral countries to choose between the sanctioned target and the US market.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (OFAC Lists)
-   **SDN List (Specially Designated Nationals):** The "Blacklist". US Persons are prohibited from dealing with them. Assets frozen.
-   **Sectoral Sanctions:** "You can lend to Russian Energy companies, but only for < 30 days." limits capital raising.

### Definition 2.2 (The "Nuclear Option")
Freezing Central Bank Reserves.
Done to Russia in 2022 ($300B frozen).
This breaks the core assumption of "Sovereign Immunity" and "Safe Assets."
Result: Acceleration of Dedollarization (Why hold reserves that can be seized?).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Unilateral vs Multilateral
Unilateral US sanctions work because most global banks need access to New York clearing houses.
"Secondary Sanctions" leverage this: "If you (French Bank) deal with Iran, you lose your US license."
Multilateral (UN/EU/US aligned) are harder to evade but harder to organize.

### 3.2 Evasion Dynamics
Target creates "Shell Companies" in neutral jurisdictions (Dubai, Turkey).
"Dark Fleet" tankers for oil export.
The Sanction Premium: Sanctioned goods trade at a discount (Russia sells oil to India at -$30/bbl).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Compliance Risk
For Banks: The fine for violating OFAC is billions (BNP Paribas paid $9B).
Compliance departments have veto power over Front Office.
"Derisking": Banks dumping entire regions (e.g., Africa/Caribbean) to avoid sanction risk.

### 4.2 Commodity Volatility
Sanctioning a major producer (Russia/Nickel, Russia/Palladium).
Supply shock.
Prices squeeze higher.
LME Nickel Squeeze (2022).
Trade: Long Commodities of sanctioned nations (before sanctions hit).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (SWIFT Ban):**
SWIFT is a messaging system, not a bank.
Banning a bank from SWIFT hampers communication but doesn't stop transfers (can use Fax/Email/Telex).
BUT, no Western bank will touch the Fax because of OFAC risk.

**Exercise 2 (The Blowback):**
Sanctions on Russian Energy caused EU energy crisis.
Inflation spiked in the Sanctioning countries.
"Economic Mutually Assured Destruction."
