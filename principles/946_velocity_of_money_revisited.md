# The Velocity of Money Revisited

## I. Executive Summary

**Velocity of Money ($V$)** is the frequency with which a unit of currency is used. Equation of Exchange: $MV = PQ$. Central Banks control $M$ (Supply). The Crowd controls $V$ (Psychology). The synthesis argues that $V$ has collapsed due to **Inequality** (Rich save, Poor spend) and **Financialization** (Money trapped in financial markets/Repos vs Real Economy).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Cantillon Trap)
Rich people have low marginal propensity to consume.
If you give Elon Musk \$1B, he buys Stocks (Asset Price Inflation). V is low.
If you give 1000 poor people \$1M, they buy Food/Cars (CPI Inflation). V is high.
QE went to the rich $\implies$ V collapsed.
Fiscal Stimulus went to the poor $\implies$ V spiked (2021).

### Definition 2.2 (Velocity of Collateral)
Manmohan Singh (IMF).
In Repo markets, collateral moves faster than money.
"Collateral Velocity."
Greasing the wheels of Shadow Banking.
If Collateral Velocity slows (Hoarding of T-Bills), financial liquidity freezes.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Gresham's Law and Velocity
"Bad money circulates."
If Inflation is high (Money is bad), people spend it fast. $V \uparrow$.
Hyperinflation: $V \to \infty$. "Hot Potato."
If Deflation is expected (Money is good), people hoard it. $V \downarrow$.
Liquidity Trap.

### 3.2 Crypto Velocity
Bitcoin HODLing.
High usage as Store of Value $\implies$ Velocity $\to$ 0.
Stablecoins (USDT).
High usage as Medium of Exchange $\implies$ Velocity is high.
Tokenomics: High Velocity tokens capture less value (Burnske). Low Velocity tokens (Staking) capture value.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Predicting Inflation
Don't just watch M2 (Money Supply).
Watch Loan Growth (Bank Credit) $\implies$ Velocity.
Watch Consumer Confidence.
If M2 Flat but V rises $\implies$ Inflation.
Currently: M2 shrinking, V rising slightly.

### 4.2 The Eurodollar Velocity
Offshore dollars move fast.
Trade finance.
If Globalization slows, Eurodollar velocity slows.
Global liquidity contraction.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The 2020 Shock):**
M2 exploded (+25%).
GDP fell.
Therefore V collapsed (-20%).
Why? Lockdowns. Massive savings rate.
When reopened, V normalized $\implies$ Inflation caught up to M.

**Exercise 2 (Negative Rates):**
Attempt to force V up.
"Use it or lose it."
Result: People hoarded Cash (physical) or Gold.
Psychological backlash causing V to drop further (Fear).
