# Intrinsic Value vs Market Price

## I. Executive Summary

**Intrinsic Value** (IV) is a theoretical construct (DCF of future cash flows). **Market Price** (MP) is the clearing price of supply/demand. Volume 10 synthesis argues that IV is a **Range**, not a number, and MP oscillates around it like a damped harmonic oscillator. The "Value Investor" bets on Mean Reversion ($MP \to IV$). The "Momentum Investor" bets on Divergence ($MP$ moves away from $IV$).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Value Range)
Uncertainty in inputs (Growth Rate, Discount Rate).
$IV_{Base} = 100$. $IV_{Bear} = 70$. $IV_{Bull} = 140$.
Range: [70, 140].
If MP = 90. Is it undervalued?
Hard to say.
If MP = 50. Strong signal.
"Margin of Safety" required to overcome model error.

### Definition 2.2 (Price Discovery)
The process by which MP finds IV.
Information arrival.
Analyst updates.
Earnings surprises.
In private markets, discovery is discrete (Appraisal).
In public markets, discovery is continuous (Ticker).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Keynes Beauty Contest
MP is not what *you* think IV is.
MP is what *average opinion* thinks *average opinion* is.
Recursive belief modeling.
Price separates from Value.
Price becomes a "Social Fact."

### 3.2 Reflexivity (Again)
If MP < IV for too long $\implies$ Company cannot raise capital $\implies$ Bankruptcy.
IV drops to 0 *because* MP was low.
Price determined Value.
Example: Bank Runs.
Value investing fails if Price destroys the business before convergence.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Activist Catalyst
Value Investor buys at discount.
Waits. Value trap?
Becomes Activist. Pushes for Buybacks / Sale.
Forces $MP \to IV$.
"Creating your own catalyst."

### 4.2 The Growth Trap
Buying high growth at any price (Nifty Fifty).
Justification: "IV is infinite if growth persists."
Reality: Growth creates competition. Margins compress.
Mean reversion of corporate returns.
Price collapses to meet a lower IV.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tesla 2020):**
Price up 700%.
Did IV increase 700%?
Yes, if you believe in EV domination + Robotaxis + Energy + AI.
Uncertainty of IV allows Price to drift anywhere.
Narrative drives Valuation.

**Exercise 2 (Deep Value):**
Cigar Butt investing.
Net Net (Cash > Price).
Clear Intrinsic Value floor.
Why does it exist?
Governance risk (Management stealing the cash).
Discount = Price of bad governance.
