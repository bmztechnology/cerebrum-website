# Space Economy The New Frontier

## I. Executive Summary

The **Space Economy** (SpaceX, Blue Origin) is transitioning from "gov-only" to "commercial." Dropping launch costs (Reusability) unlocks **Satellite Internet** (Starlink), **Asteroid Mining** (Platinum/Rare Earths), and **Zero-G Manufacturing**. The synthesis views Space as the ultimate **Emerging Market**, offering uncorrelated returns and infinite resource upside.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Launch Cost Curve)
Space Shuttle: \$50,000 / kg.
Falcon 9: \$2,500 / kg.
Starship: \$100 / kg (Target).
Moore's Law for Space.
Elasticity of Demand: At \$100/kg, new business models work (Space Tourism, Solar Power Satellites).

### Definition 2.2 (Kessler Syndrome)
Space Debris.
Chain reaction of collisions.
Polluting Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
The "Climate Change" of Space.
Risk to asset values (Satellites destroyed).
Need "Space Garbage Trucks" (Removal Startups).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Infinite Resource Thesis
Earth is finite (Malthus).
Space is infinite.
Psyche 16 (Asteroid) contains \$10 Quintillion of metals?
If mined, Gold becomes worthless (Democratization of scarcity).
The concept of "Value" changes from "Scarcity" to "Utility."

### 3.2 Geopolitics of Orbit
Who owns the Moon?
Outer Space Treaty (1967) says "Everyone."
Reality: "First to occupy owns the water ice."
Artemis Accords (US) vs China Lunar Base.
Space Force protects "Orbital Lines of Communication."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Earth Observation (EO) Alpha
Satellites counting cars in Walmart parking lots (Retail sales).
Checking oil tank shadows (Inventory).
Measuring crop health (Commodity Futures).
Information arbitrage from orbit.
Planet Labs.

### 4.2 Low Latency Trading
Starlink lasers in vacuum (speed of light).
Fiber on Earth (speed of light / 1.5).
HFT via Space is faster than Fiber.
"Hollow Earth" routing.
New arms race for latency.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Venture Capital in Space):**
High Capex. Long Time Horizon.
Is it VC? Or Infrastructure?
Requires "Patient Capital."
Success rate low, payoff infinite.

**Exercise 2 (Sovereign Risk):**
Anti-Satellite Weapons (ASAT).
Russia blows up satellite. Debris field.
War in Space takes out GPS.
Global financial freeze (GPS timestamps everything).
Tail risk.
