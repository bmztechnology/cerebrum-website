# Benchmark Selection Bias: Gaming

## I. Executive Summary

**Benchmark Selection Bias** involves choosing an inappropriate benchmark to flatter a portfolio's performance. Common tactics include using a **Price Return** index (excluding dividends) to beat, selecting a **Broad Market** index for a narrow sector fund, or using a **Lower Risk** benchmark (e.g., Aggregate Bond) for a High Yield fund. Proper attribution requires a benchmark that reflects the manager's investment universe and risk profile.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Performance Gaming)
Fund Return: 8%.
S&P 500 (TR): 10%.
Manager: "I beat the S&P 500 Price Index (8.5%)!" (ignoring dividends).
Manager: "I beat the Russell 2000 (Small Cap)!" (Fund is Large Cap).
Manager: "I beat Cash!" (In a Bull market).

### Definition 2.2 (Custom Benchmarks)
"70% S&P 500 + 30% AGG."
Calculated daily vs monthly?
Rebalanced daily vs monthly?
Drift in custom benchmark calculation can create 50-100bps of noise.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Normal Portfolios
Benchmark should represent the "Normal Portfolio" (Strategic Asset Allocation).
Characteristics:
1.  Unambiguous.
2.  Investable (ETFs exist).
3.  Measurable.
4.  Appropriate.
5.  Reflective of current investment opinions.
6.  Specified in advance.

### 3.2 Peer Groups
Comparning to "Category Average" (Morningstar).
Bias: Category is messy.
"Large Growth" category contains Tech funds and Healthcare funds.
If Tech rallies, Tech fund looks like "Top Quartile."
Just Sector Beta.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Hedge Fund Benchmarks
Absolute Return? "Cash + 5%".
Easy to beat in Bull Market. Hard in Bear.
HFRI Index? (Survivorship bias).
Best benchmark: Factor Replication Portfolio (Clone).
Compare HF Alpha over the Clone.

### 4.2 Private Equity
Benchmarking PE (IRR) to S&P 500 (PME - Public Market Equivalent).
Kaplan-Schoar PME.
Did illiquidity pay off?
Usually PE beats S&P 500 by just enough to cover fees? Or not even?
Debate rages.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fixed Income):**
Beating the Agg.
Agg is 70% Treasuries/MBS. Yield 4%.
Manager buys Corp Bonds. Yield 6%.
Outperformance is just Credit Beta.
Benchmark should be Credit Index.

**Exercise 2 (Currency):**
Global Fund (Unhedged). Benchmark (Hedged).
Dollar falls. Fund wins.
Pure currency bet.
Benchmark should match hedging policy.
