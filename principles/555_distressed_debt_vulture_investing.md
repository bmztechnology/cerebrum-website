# Distressed Debt Vulture Investing

## I. Executive Summary

**Distressed Debt Investing** involves purchasing the bonds or bank loans of companies in or near bankruptcy. The goal is not just the yield, but **Control**. Vulture investors aim to become the **Fulcrum Security** holder—the creditor class that ends up owning the equity of the reorganized company after wiping out the original shareholders. It is a legal, aggressive, and highly specialized strategy.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Fulcrum Security)
In a restructuring waterfall:
Senior Debt: Paid 100%.
**Subordianted Debt: Paid in Equity.** (The Fulcrum).
Equity: Wiped out ($0).
The investor buys the Sub-Debt at 30 cents, swaps it for New Equity worth 60 cents.

### Definition 2.2 (Blocking Position)
Chapter 11 requires approval by classes of creditors.
Buying 33.4% of a bond tranch allows the holder to "Block" a plan.
Leverage to negotiate better terms ("Holdout Value").

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Enterprise Value (EV) vs Capital Structure
Value the business (EV) independent of the debt.
Compare EV to the Debt Stack.
Identify the break-point.
Buy just above the break-point (Senior enough to get paid, junior enough to get upside).

### 3.2 The J-Curve of Bankruptcy
Price crashes on filing (Panic selling by mandates).
Price stagnates during legal battles (uncertainty).
Price recovers upon Plan of Reorganization (POR) confirmation.
Investor provides "Liquidity of last resort."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Loan-to-Own
Explicit strategy to take control.
Buy debt. Block restructuring. Force easy terms or foreclosure.
Convert debt to equity. Appoint new Board. Fix operations. Sell.
Private Equity via the back door (cheaper entry).

### 4.2 Litigation Alpha
Suing for "Fraudulent Conveyance."
Did the company transfer assets to shareholders before bankruptcy?
Clawing back value.
Alpha depends on the courtroom, not the market.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Cramdown):**
Judge forces a plan on dissenting creditors.
"Absolute Priority Rule": Seniors must be paid in full before Juniors get a dime.
Unless Seniors "Gift" value to Juniors to speed up the process.

**Exercise 2 (Credit Default Swaps):**
Buying Bonds + Buying CDS (Basis Trade).
Negative Basis package?
Or "Net Short" debt? (Windstream case: Aurelius declared default to trigger CDS).
