# The Psychology of Taxes

## I. Executive Summary

**Taxes** trigger intense behavioral responses that exceed their economic cost. **Tax Aversion** (hating paying taxes more than other costs) leads to sub-optimal decisions like holding losers to avoid "wasting" a write-off or holding winners to avoid paying capital gains (Lock-in Effect). The complex interplay of **Fairness**, **Complexity**, and **Salience** makes tax policy a minefield of behavioral quirks.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Lock-In Effect)
Investor holds stock with \$100k gain.
wants to diversify.
Selling triggers \$20k tax Bill.
Investor refuses to sell. "I won't give Uncle Sam \$20k."
Stock drops \$30k.
The tax tail wags the investment dog.

### Definition 2.2 (Salience)
Sales Tax not included in sticker price (USA).
VAT included (Europe).
USA consumers underestimate cost $\implies$ Spend more?
Chetty (2009): Making tax salient reduces demand.
"Out of sight, out of mind."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Mental Accounting of Refunds
Tax Refund = "Government Bonus."
Used for indulgences.
Withholding too little = "Owing Money."
Painful.
People prefer Over-withholding (Interest free loan to Govt) to avoid the pain of writing a check in April.
Paying for self-control.

### 3.2 Tax Morale
Why do people pay taxes when audit rate is < 1%?
Intrinsic motivation / Social Norm.
"Civic Duty."
If perception of fairness drops (Politicians cheating), Tax Morale collapses -> Evasion spikes.
Greece case study.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Municipal Bonds
Yield < Treasuries.
But Tax Free.
High bracket investors overestimate the value of "Tax Free"?
"Suppose I'm in the 50% bracket..."
Status symbol of avoiding taxes.

### 4.2 Loss Harvesting Services
Wealthfront/Betterment.
"We pay our fees with tax savings."
Selling the "Free Lunch."
Very effective marketing hook because it targets the Tax Aversion pain point.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Realization Effect):**
Realizing a gain is voluntary (Tax event).
Receiving a dividend is involuntary (Tax event).
Investors prefer Buybacks (Capital Gains) to Dividends partly for tax control, but also because Dividends force a tax decision.

**Exercise 2 (Estate Tax):**
"Death Tax."
Framing.
People spend millions on trusts to save thousands in taxes.
Spite against the taxman.
