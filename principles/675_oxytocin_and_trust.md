# Oxytocin and Trust

## I. Executive Summary

**Oxytocin** is the "Bonding Hormone" (Love/Trust). In finance, it facilitates **Trust** between strangers, which is essential for liquidity and credit. Zak (2005) showed that administering Oxytocin increases money transfers in Trust Games. However, high Oxytocin can also lead to **Gullibility** (falling for Ponzis) and **Herding** (excessive in-group conformity).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trust Molecule)
Paul Zak.
Trust Game: Investor sends money to Trustee.
Oxytocin levels predict the amount sent.
Spray Oxytocin up the nose $\implies$ Generosity increases 80%.
Biological basis of "market confidence."

### Definition 2.2 (In-Group Bias)
Oxytocin promotes bonding with *Us*.
It promotes aggression towards *Them*.
De Dreu.
In markets: "Permabulls" bonding against "Permabears."
Tribalism in Crypto communities ("WAGMI").
Oxytocin fuels the echo chamber.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Bubbles Mechanism
Euphoria + Social Bonding.
"We are all making money together."
Oxytocin loop.
Skeptics are excluded from the tribe.
The crash breaks the trust $\implies$ Oxytocin crashes $\implies$ Liquidity evaporates.

### 3.2 Counterparty Risk
We trust people who "look like us" or "smile."
Basic Oxytocin triggers.
Madoff used this (Affinity fraud).
Effective Due Diligence requires suppressing the Oxytocin response (Professional cynicism).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.2 Detecting Fraud

Rule: If you *like* the manager too much, double the diligence.
Charm is a red flag.

## V. Exercises
