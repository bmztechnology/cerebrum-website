# Crisis Alpha Strategies: Convergent vs Divergent

## I. Executive Summary

**Crisis Alpha** refers to strategies that generate positive returns specifically during market stress, offsetting losses in the core portfolio. Unlike passive hedges (Puts), these are active strategies. The main categories are **Trend Following (CTA)** (Divergent) and **Long Volatility** (Convergent/Options). They differ from "Safe Havens" (Gold) by offering potential for massive convex gains rather than just capital preservation.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Divergent Strategies)
Betting on trends continuing.
Crisis = Large Trend (Crash).
Managed Futures (CTA) Short Stocks, Long Bonds, Short Oil.
Profits from the persistence of the crisis move.
"Run your winners."

### Definition 2.2 (Convergent Strategies)
Betting on mean reversion.
Short Volatility, Arbitrage.
These usually *blow up* in a crisis (Crisis Beta).
Crisis Alpha requires avoiding these.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Smile of CTA
CTAs perform well in:
-   Strong Bull Markets (Long Trend).
-   Strong Bear Markets (Short Trend).
-   Poorly in Sideways/Reversal markets ("The Smile").
Since Crises are usually strong trends, CTAs provide Crisis Alpha.

### 3.2 Long Volatility
Buying Straddles/VIX.
Bleeds in normal times.
Explodes in crisis.
Challenge: Minimizing the "Cost of Carry" during the waiting period.
Active trading of Gamma to pay for Theta.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The 60/40/20 Portfolio
60% Stocks / 40% Bonds.
Add 20% (leverage or carving out) to Trend Following.
Reduces Max Drawdown.
Speeds up recovery (Watermark).
"Portable Alpha."

### 4.2 Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA)
Historically, CTAs were the only group positive in 2008 (+14%).
In 2022 (Inflation), CTAs were positive (Short Bonds, Long Commodities).
"The best diversifier is a strategy, not an asset class."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Lookback Bias):**
Many strategies claim Crisis Alpha.
"Quality Factor." "Low Vol Factor."
Often fail in real correlations.
Only Trend and Long Vol have mechanical reasons to win in crashes.

**Exercise 2 (Speed):**
Crisis speed matters.
Slow Grinding Bear (2000): CTA wins big.
Flash Crash (2020): CTA might be too slow to catch the move, and gets whipped on recovery.
Fast crises require Option hedges. Slow crises require Trend hedges.
