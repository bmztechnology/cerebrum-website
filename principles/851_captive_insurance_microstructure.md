# Captive Insurance Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

A **Captive** is an insurance company owned by the entity it insures (e.g., Apple insuring Apple). It allows corporations to **Retain Risk**, lower costs (bypass commercial profit margins), and access **Reinsurance Markets** directly. Microstructure involves **Transfer Pricing** (Premiums must be actuarially sound to satisfy IRS) and **Domicile Selection** (Bermuda vs Vermont).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Pure Captive)
Single Parent.
Risks: Property, Workers Comp, Cyber.
Benefits:
1. Investment Income (Keep premiums and invest them).
2. Custom Coverage (Cover risks commercial market won't touch).
3. Tax Deduction (Premiums paid to captive are deductible, reserves grow tax-deferred).

### Definition 2.2 (The Fronting Arrangement)
Multinational Corp needs a certificate of insurance in Brazil.
Captive is not licensed in Brazil.
Hires a "Fronting Carrier" (AIG) to issue policy in Brazil.
AIG reinsures 100% of risk back to Captive.
AIG takes a "Fronting Fee" (5%).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Risk Retention vs Transfer
Commercial Insurance: Transfer Risk. Cost = Loss + Expense + Profit.
Captive: Retain Risk. Cost = Loss + Expense.
Profit is recaptured.
Efficient for "High Frequency, Low Severity" losses (predictable).
Inefficient for "Peak Peril" (requires external capital).

### 3.2 831(b) Micro-Captives
Small captives (< \$2.8M premiums).
Tax election: Taxed only on Investment Income, not Underwriting Income.
Abused by wealthy individuals for estate planning?
IRS crackdown on "Abusive Captives."
Microstructure: Must demonstrate real risk distribution (Risk Pooling).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Third Party Business
Captive insures parent (50%).
Captive insures customers (50%). (e.g., Extended Warranty).
Profit center.

"Turning a cost center into a profit center."

### 4.2 Deductible Buy-Down
Commercial Deductible is \$1M (Hard Market).
Divisions can't afford \$1M hit.
Captive issues policy to Divisions with \$50k deductible.
Captive eats the \$50k-\$1M layer.
Internal smoothing.
