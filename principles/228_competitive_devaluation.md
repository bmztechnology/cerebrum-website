# Competitive Devaluation: Beggar-Thy-Neighbor

## I. Executive Summary

**Competitive Devaluation** (Currency War) is a policy where nations intentionally weaken their currency to boost exports and domestic employment at the expense of trading partners. This zero-sum game often leads to retaliation (Tariffs), protectionism, and a collapse in global trade volume, as seen in the 1930s Great Depression.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Mechanism)
Country A lowers interest rates or prints money.
Currency A depreciates against Currency B.
Exports A become cheaper for B consumers.
Imports B become expensive for A consumers.
Result: A's Trade Balance improves. B's Trade Balance worsens (Unemployment imports).

### Definition 2.2 (The Prisoner's Dilemma)
If A devalues, B *must* devalue to protect its industry.
Nash Equilibrium: Everyone devalues.
Result: Relative exchange rates stay the same, but Global Inflation rises (Import prices up everywhere).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 J-Curve Effect
Devaluation makes Trade Balance worse initially (Import prices rise instantly, Export volume reacts slowly).
After 12-18 months, Volume effects dominate Price effects.
Balance improves.
Warning: If Country has dollar-debt, Devaluation bankrupts them before the J-Curve turns up.

### 3.2 Redistribution
Devaluation is a tax on consumers (Imports expensive).
And a subsidy to manufacturers (Exports competitive).
It transfers wealth from Labor to Capital owners (Exporters).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 "Reverse Currency War" (2022)
Everyone wanted *Stronger* currency to fight inflation.
US hiked rates.
Others forced to hike to defend currency (not to export).
Exporting Deflation.

### 4.2 Safe Haven Paradox
Japan wants weak Yen for Toyota.
But in crisis, Yen strengthens (Safe Haven).
Japan must intervene to stop the "Safe Haven" appreciation hitting its economy.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Brazil 2010):**
Guido Mantega coined "Currency War."
US QE flooded Brazil with dollars. BRL rallied. Brazilian industry died.
Brazil imposed taxes (IOF) to stop the appreciation.

**Exercise 2 (Volatility Strategy):**
In Currency War, Volatility is high but Trend is choppy (Interventions).
Mean Reversion strategies work better than Trend Following during overt currency wars.
