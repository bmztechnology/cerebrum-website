# Quality Minus Junk QMJ: Profitability

## I. Executive Summary

**Quality (QMJ)** is the factor that buys companies with high profitability, safety, and growth, and shorts companies with low profitability (Junk). Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen (2013) demonstrated that high-quality stocks deliver higher risk-adjusted returns, contradicting the standard risk-return tradeoff (where safer stocks should yield *less*). Quality acts as a "Defensive" factor with long-term alpha.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Q Score)
Composite of:
1.  **Profitability:** Gross Profits / Assets (Novy-Marx's GPA). Return on Equity (ROE).
2.  **Growth:** 5-year change in profits.
3.  **Safety:** Low Beta, Low Leverage, Low Volatility of Earnings.
4.  **Payout:** Net Share Buybacks + Dividends (Signaling cash flow strength).

### Definition 2.2 (The Anomaly)
Safe, profitable companies should be expensive (High P/E).
They are. But not expensive *enough*.
Investors undervalue composite quality or overvalue "lottery ticket" Junk stocks.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Resurrection of Size
When controlling for QMJ, the Size Factor (SMB) becomes significant again.
Small Cap Junk performs terribly.
Small Cap Quality performs amazingly.
The "Size" premium is really a "Small Quality" premium masked by junk.

### 3.2 Quality at a Reasonable Price (GARP)
Buffett's evolution.
Graham: Buy "Cigar Butts" (Deep Value, Low Quality).
Munger: Buy "Great businesses at fair prices" (Quality).
Buffett's Alpha can be explained by leveraging the QMJ factor.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Flight to Quality
In recessions, QMJ outperforms.
Boring companies (Coca-Cola, J&J) keep earning.
High Beta Tech/Junk crashes.
QMJ is a hedge against tail risk?
Usually, yes.

### 4.2 Accruals Anomaly
Sloan (1996).
Companies with high Accruals (Earnings > Cash Flow) underperform.
High Quality scoring penalizes high accruals.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Sector Neutrality):**
Tech has high margins (High Quality?). Utilities have high debt (Low Quality?).
Must normalize Q scores by sector.
"Best in class" approach.

**Exercise 2 (Interaction with Value):**
Value trap = Cheap stock + Low Quality.
Value opp = Cheap stock + Average Quality.
Adding QMJ filter to Value screen avoids traps.
