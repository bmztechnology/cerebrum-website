# Seasonal Adjustment in Inflation: Carry Trade

## I. Executive Summary

**Consumer Prices** exhibit strong, predictable seasonality. Energy and Apparel prices fluctuate with weather and seasons. TIPS and Inflation Swaps use **Non-Seasonally Adjusted (NSA)** CPI for cash flows. The **Fed** and Media focus on **Seasonally Adjusted (SA)** data. The discrepancy creates predictable "Inflation Carry" patterns: TIPS accrue principal rapidly in H1 (Spring) and slowly (or negatively) in Q4.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Seasonal Factors)
BLS calculates Seasonal Factors (Multiplier).
$SA = \frac{NSA}{Factor}$.
Factors change predictably.
-   **Spring:** Factors < 1 (Traffic, Travel). NSA > SA.
-   **Winter:** Factors > 1 (Holiday Discounting). NSA < SA.

### Definition 2.2 (Carry Calculation)
Month 1: Expect SA +0.2%. Factor implies NSA +0.6%.
Month 2: Expect SA +0.2%. Factor implies NSA -0.1%.
Hold TIPS in Month 1. Sell in Month 2.
Capture the 0.6% accrual.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Efficient Market?
Is this priced in?
Yes, Breakevens (Front End) oscillate.
Jan 1Y Breakeven > July 1Y Breakeven.
Pricing the "Carry."
But deviations occur due to flow (Retail buying based on SA headlines vs Pros trading NSA curves).

### 3.2 Residual Seasonality
Even SA data has "Residual Seasonality."
Fed puzzling over why Q1 PCE is always strong.
Methodological imperfections.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Curve Shape
Inflation Curve is sawtooth in the front end (Seasonality).
Smooth in the long end.
Trading 1Y swap vs 18M swap requires precise monthly weighting.

### 4.2 Tax Alpha
Buy TIPS when Accrual is low (Price lower?).
No, Price (Real Price) is clean.
But Accrued Interest and Index Ratio dynamics matter for tax lots.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Gasoline):**
Driving season (Memorial Day to Labor Day).
Gas prices rise.
NSA Energy component spikes.
TIPS perform well in Summer.

**Exercise 2 (Rent):**
OER/Rent is non-seasonal?
Actually, leases turn over in Spring/Summer.
Rents rise more in warm months.
Winter is dead season.
Adds to the Spring Carry bias.
