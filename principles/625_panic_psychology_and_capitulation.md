# Panic Psychology and Capitulation

## I. Executive Summary

**Panic** is the sudden, simultaneous attempt by market participants to exit positions. It is characterized by a breakdown of **Information Processing**, a spike in **Correlations**, and the evaporation of **Liquidity**. **Capitulation** marks the bottom: the moment when the last bull gives up (pukes the position), transferring assets from "Weak Hands" to "Strong Hands" at fire-sale prices.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Liquidity Black Hole)
In panic, Market Makers widen spreads or withdraw quotes.
Price gaps down.
Stop loss orders trigger into the gap.
Cascading sales.
No buyers.
"The bid disappeared."

### Definition 2.2 (VIX Spike)
Panic $\implies$ Demand for Puts $\implies$ Implied Volatility explodes.
VIX > 40 usually signals panic.
VIX > 80 (2008, 2020) signals total system failure.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Amygdala Hijack
Fear center of the brain takes over.
Prefrontal cortex (Logic) shuts down.
Fight or Flight.
In markets, "Flight" = Sell at Market.
Rational valuation is impossible during an hijack.

### 3.2 Revulsion
After the crash.
Investors vow "Never again."
Low volume. Low volatility.
The bottom is not a V-shape, but a long "L-shape" of disinterest (Despair).
This is the Accumulation Zone for smart money.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Buying Blood
Rothschild: "Buy when there is blood in the streets."
Psychologically nearly impossible.
Requires "Pre-commitment" (Limit orders placed deeply below market).

### 4.2 Circuit Breakers
Exchanges halt trading (Level 1: 7%, Level 2: 13%, Level 3: 20%).
Time out allows Amygdala to cool down and System 2 to re-engage.
Preventing the feedback loop of algo destruction.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Forced Selling):**
Margin Calls.
The seller *must* sell. Price is irrelevant.
Identify who is margined (Leveraged ETFs, Hedge Funds).
Front run their liquidation.

**Exercise 2 (Look for Divergence):**
Market makes new low.
RSI makes higher low.
VIX makes lower high.
Panic is exhausting itself. Capitulation is complete.
