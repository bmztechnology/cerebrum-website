# Islamic Finance Sukuk Structures

## I. Executive Summary

**Islamic Finance** operates under **Sharia Law**, which prohibits **Riba** (Interest), **Gharar** (Excessive Uncertainty/Gambling), and investment in sin sectors (Alcohol/Pork). The bond equivalent is **Sukuk** (Asset-Backed Certification). Instead of lending money for interest (Debt), the investor buys an asset and leases it back to the borrower (Profit Rate). Microstructure involves **Sharia Boards** and special purpose vehicles (SPVs).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Sukuk al-Ijara - Lease)
Issuer sells building to SPV.
SPV sells Sukuk to Investors.
SPV owns building.
SPV leases building back to Issuer.
Lease payments = "Coupon."
At maturity, Issuer buys building back.
Economic equivalent of a bond, but structured as a Sale-Leaseback.

### Definition 2.2 (Murabaha - Cost-Plus)
Bank buys car for \$20k.
Sells car to Customer for \$25k (to be paid in installments).
Profit \$5k allowed (Trade).
Interest \$5k prohibited (Money on Money).
Result: Fixed Rate financing.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Asset Backed vs Asset Based
**Asset Backed:** Investors actually own the airport. If default, they can sell the airport. (True Sukuk).
**Asset Based:** Investors have a claim on the cash flow, but not legal title to sell the asset. (Most commercial Sukuk).
Risk: In default (Dana Gas case), Issuer claimed "This structure is not Sharia compliant anymore, so I don't have to pay."
Sharia Risk as legal risk.

### 3.2 Takaful (Insurance)
Conventional Insurance = Gambling (Betting against accident)?
Takaful = Mutual Guarantee.
Members contribute to pool.
Claims paid from pool.
Surplus distributed to members.
Cooperative structure.
