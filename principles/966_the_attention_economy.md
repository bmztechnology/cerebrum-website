# The Attention Economy

## I. Executive Summary

**Attention** is the scarce resource in an information-abundant world. Tech giants (Meta, Google, TikTok) extract attention to sell Ads. This **Extraction Model** (Dopamine Loops) has negative externalities: **Polarization**, **Addiction**, and **Short-Termism**. The synthesis argues that Finance is becoming an Attention Economy: Asset prices follow **Eyeballs**, not Cash Flows.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Attention Metrics)
Daily Active Users (DAU).
Time Spent.
Engagement Rate.
In the Attention Economy, these *are* the fundamentals.
Stock Price $\propto$ Engagement.
GameStop: High Attention / Low Earnings.
Tesla: Infinite Attention.

### Definition 2.2 (Mimetic Desire - Girard)
We want what others want.
Social Media accelerates mimesis.
Trends explode faster.
"Influencer" is the broker of mimetic desire.
Investing led by Influencers (FinTwit/YouTubers).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The surveillance Dividend
Free Product (Search) $\implies$ User is the Product.
Data collected $\implies$ Behavior modified (Ads).
Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff).
Regulatory backlash (GDPR).
Apple (Privacy) vs Meta (Tracking) war.

### 3.2 Information Overload
Herbert Simon (1971): "Wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."
Filters become valuable.
Curators.
Algorithms are the ultimate filters.
Whoever controls the Feed controls the World View (and the Market View).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long the Dealer, Short the User
Long Tech Platforms (Dealers of Dopamine).
Short Companies relying on "Deep Work" (impacted by distraction)?
Or Short the User (Bet on societal decline)?

### 4.2 Branding as Moat
In a noisy world, Brand is the only signal.
Luxury (LVMH) dominates.
Strong IP (Disney/Nintendo) dominates.
Commodities struggle to get attention.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (TikTok Algo):**
The most effective attention capture machine.
User intent doesn't matter; observing subconscious reaction (dwell time).
Weaponized distractability.

**Exercise 2 (The Detox Trend):**
