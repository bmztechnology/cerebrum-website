# Rolling Futures Contracts: The Yield

## I. Executive Summary

Futures expire. Long-term investors (ETF holders, Commodity Funds) must **Roll** their positions (Sell expiring M1, Buy next M2). The **Roll Yield** is generated by the price difference. In **Backwardation** (M2 < M1), rolling is profitable (Buy Low, Sell High). In **Contango** (M2 > M1), rolling is costly (Buy High, Sell Low). This structural bleed destroys returns of long-term holders in Contango markets (e.g., VIX, Natural Gas).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Calendar Spread)
Quotes as $Spread = F_{far} - F_{near}$.
Contango Market: Spread is Positive.
Backwardation: Spread is Negative.
Traders trade the Spread directly to bet on "Curve Shape."

### Definition 2.2 (Negative Roll Yield)
USO (Oil ETF).
Holds Front Month.
Oil in Contango (Spot 40, Future 41).
Every month, Sell at 40, Buy at 41.
Loss = $1 per month.
Spot can stay flat at 40, but ETF drops 2.5% per month.
"The Silent Killer."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Keynes' Theory of Normal Backwardation
Producers (Farmers/Miners) are natural hedgers (Short Futures).
Speculators are Long.
Speculators demand a premium (insurance).
Therefore, Future < Expected Spot.
Price must rise to meet Spot.
Positive Roll Yield for Longs.
Reality: Holds for some markets, not others (Gold is always Contango).

### 3.2 Storage Theory
Contango = Storage Cost.
If inventories are high, Storage is scarce $\implies$ Contango widens.
If inventories are low, Convenience Yield spikes $\implies$ Backwardation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Curve Rolling
Strategy: Instead of rolling to M2 (steepest part of curve).
Roll to M12 (flatter part).
Reduced negative roll yield.
Enhanced returns for Commodity Indexes (GSCI Enhanced).

### 4.2 The "Goldman Roll"
Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) rolls on 5th-9th business day.
Predictable flow.
HFTs/Locals "Front run" the roll.
Sell M1 / Buy M2 before Goldman.
Buy M1 / Sell M2 after Goldman.
Extracts value from the Index Funds.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Natural Gas):**
Widowmaker Spread (March/April).
Winter End vs Spring Start.
Storage constraints.
Spread volatility is higher than outright volatility.

**Exercise 2 (Negative Prices Roll):**
USO changed roll schedule in 2020 to avoid negative prices.
Moved out the curve.
Saved the fund from liquidation.
Active management of passive product.
