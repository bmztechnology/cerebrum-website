# Sports Cards and Market Manipulation

## I. Executive Summary

The **Sports Card** market (PSA 10 Michael Jordan Rookie) experienced a hyper-bubble in 2020-2021. Microstructure features include **PWCC** (Vault/Exchange), **Shill Bidding** on eBay, and **Population Control** by grading companies. The market is rife with **Wash Trading** intended to set new "Comps" (Comparable Sales) to reprice entire inventories.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Trimmed Card)
Altering a card (cutting edges) to improve centering/corners.
"Doctors."
If PSA detects $\implies$ Worthless.
If PSA misses $\implies$ PSA 10 (\$100k).
Fraudulent arbitrage.

### Definition 2.2 (The Bounty)
Dealer offers \$1M for the "One Ring" card (Magic The Gathering).
Public offer sets the floor price.
Marketing stunt + Price Discovery.
Liquidity event for a unique asset.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Shill Bidding Mechanics
eBay auction. Currently \$50k.
Seller uses Alt account to bid \$90k.
Real buyer bids \$95k.
Seller wins.
Price established at \$95k.
If Real buyer stops at \$80k?
Seller "wins" their own item. Pays eBay fees (Cost of fabrication).
Retries later with new "Comp" history.

### 3.2 Fractionals as Exit Liquidity
Whales sell \$5M card to Collectable (Fractional App).
Collectable IPOs it to retail.
Whale cashes out.
Retail stuck with illiquid shares.
Distribution mechanism.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Prospecting
Buying Rookie cards of unproven players.
"Call Option" on their career.
High theta decay (Value drops if they don't perform immediately).
99% of prospects go to zero.

### 4.2 The Junk Wax Era
1990s cards produced in millions.
Zero scarcity.
PSA 10 Gems still command premium because centering was bad.
"Condition Rarity" in a sea of junk.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The PSA Shutdown):**
2021. PSA overwhelmed by submissions (Pokemon).
Suspended all lower tier services.
Supply constraints.
Price of graded cards spiked (Flow stopped).
Microstructure bottleneck.

**Exercise 2 (PWCC vs eBay):**
eBay banned PWCC for shill bidding.
PWCC launched own platform.
Fragmented liquidity.
Arbitrage between platforms.
