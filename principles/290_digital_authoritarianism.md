# Digital Authoritarianism: The Social Credit Economy

## I. Executive Summary

**Digital Authoritarianism** leverages Big Data, AI, and Surveillance to control social and economic behavior. The archetype is China's **Social Credit System**, where financial trustworthiness (Credit Score) is merged with moral/political obedience. This creates a "Nudging State" where economic access (Loans, Travel, Internet speed) is conditional on compliance.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Panopticon Effect)
Bentham's Prison: Prisoner doesn't know if he is watched, so he behaves *as if* he is watched 24/7.
Digital Panopticon: Cameras + facial recognition + online history.
Self-censorship becomes the default economic choice.

### Definition 2.2 (Data Fusion)
Combining silos:
-   Financial Data (Alipay).
-   Social Data (WeChat).
-   Govt Data (Police records).
Result: A holistic "Score."
Buying diapers = +Points (Responsible). Buying Alcohol = -Points.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff)
West: Google extracts data to predict behavior for *Ads* (Profit).
East: State extracts data to predict behavior for *Control* (Stability).
Convergence? Western Govts buying data from Data Brokers.

### 3.2 The Great Firewall Economics
Protectionism for ideas.
Blocks Google/Facebook. allows Baidu/Tencent to thrive.
Data Sovereignty.
"Data is the new Oil."
China blocks "Data Export."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shorting Human Rights Risks
Companies enabling surveillance (Hikvision, SenseTime).
Subject to US Sanctions (Entity List).
Investment Risk: Moral hazard + Sanction risk.

### 4.2 The "Splinternet" Trade
Buy Baidu (China Search). Buy Yandex (Russia Search). Buy Google (West Search).
Global monopolies are dead. Regional champions win.
Fragmented internet infrastructure.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Canada Trucker Protests):**
Govt froze bank accounts of protesters without court order.
Utilized financial surveillance infrastructure.
Western version of Social Credit?
Demonstrated the power of "Financial De-platforming."

**Exercise 2 (AI Policing):**
Predictive Policing algorithms.
"Pre-crime."
Bias in training data reinforces inequality.
Economic impact: Redlining of entire neighborhoods based on AI risk score.
