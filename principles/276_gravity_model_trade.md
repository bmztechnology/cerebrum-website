# Gravity Model of Trade: The Physics of Commerce

## I. Executive Summary

The **Gravity Model** is the most robust empirical finding in international economics. It adapts Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: Trade flows between two countries are proportional to their economic mass (GDP) and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Despite the internet ("Death of Distance"), geography still dictates destiny.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Equation)
$$F_{ij} = G \times \frac{M_i M_j}{D_{ij}}$$
-   $F_{ij}$: Trade Flow.
-   $M_{i}, M_{j}$: GDP of countries.
-   $D_{ij}$: Distance (Physical, Cultural, Linguistic).
-   $G$: Constant (Barriers/Borders).

### Definition 2.2 (Distance Variables)
-   **Physical:** Kilometers. Shipping cost.
-   **Cultural:** Common Language? (UK-US trade > UK-Germany trade relative to distance?).
-   **Colonial:** Historic ties (France-Africa).
-   **Administrative:** FTAs, Currency Unions.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Border Effect (McCallum)
Trade between US and Canada (Toronto-Seattle).
Distance is short. Language same.
But Trade is 10x LESS than trade between Seattle and Chicago (Similar distance).
Borders matter immensely. Legal frictions. Home Bias.

### 3.2 The Linder Hypothesis
Countries trade with others of similar Per Capita Income.
Rich buy from Rich (High quality differentiation).
Contradicts Heckscher-Ohlin? No, explains Intra-Industry Trade (Germans buying Fords, Americans buying Mercedes).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Brexit Impact
UK left EU (Distance $\approx$ 0).
Wanted to trade with Australia (Distance $\approx$ 15,000km).
Gravity Model says: Suicide.
Growth of trade with Australia cannot mathematically replace loss of trade with EU.
Macro Forecast: Structural GDP loss for UK.

### 4.2 Regional Blocs
RCEP (Asia). USMCA (North America). EU.
World fragmenting into "Gravity Zones."
Investment Strategy: Buy the Regional Champion (Mexico for US, Poland for EU, Vietnam for China).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Portfolios):**
Equity Portfolios also exhibit Gravity Bias.
"Home Bias."
US investors hold 70% US stocks.
Should be 50% based on Market Cap.
Information Asymmetry increases with distance.

**Exercise 2 (Digital Trade):**
Does Internet kill Gravity?
Data flows? Yes.
Services (Zoom)? Partial cancellation.
But Time Zones remain. Hard to work India-US hours relative to US-LatAm hours.
"Digital Gravity" exists (Time Zones).
