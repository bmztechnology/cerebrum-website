# Reverse Repo RRP Facility: The Floor

## I. Executive Summary

The Fed's **Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP)** Facility acts as the floor for short-term interest rates. It allows eligible counterparties (Money Market Funds, GSEs, Banks) to lend cash to the Fed at a fixed rate, secured by Treasuries. By providing a risk-free investment option, it ensures market rates do not fall below the target range, absorbing excess liquidity (Quantitative Tightening).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Mechanism)
Counterparty lends Cash to Fed. Fed posts Treasuries as collateral.
Rate = Floor of Fed Targets (e.g., 5.30%).
Effectively: The Fed becomes the borrower of last resort.
Takes cash *out* of the banking system (Reserves) and puts it into the Fed's liability structure.

### Definition 2.2 (Drain vs Fill)
-   **QE:** Fed buys bonds, adds Reserves. Cash is abundant.
-   **RRP:** Fed borrows cash, locks it away overnight.
Huge RRP usage ($2 Trillion in 2023) signaled massive excess liquidity in the system.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB)
The rate Banks earn at Fed.
Rules: Banks earn IORB. MMFs (who can't hold reserves) earn RRP.
Usually IORB > RRP (to incentivize Banks to lend).
Arbitrage: Banks borrow from MMFs at $<$ IORB and deposit at IORB?
Yes, but constrained by Balance Sheet costs (SLR).

### 3.2 Leaky Floor
Before RRP (2008-2013), Fed Funds traded *below* IORB because GSEs (Fannie/Freddie) had cash but couldn't earn interest at Fed.
They sold cash cheap.
RRP fixed this by giving GSEs a place to park cash.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 MMF Asset Allocation
Money Market Funds choose: T-Bills vs Repo vs Fed RRP.
If T-Bill yields drop below RRP (scarcity), MMFs flock to RRP.
If T-Bill yields rise (heavy issuance), MMFs leave RRP and buy Bills.
RRP usage is the "Marginal Demand" for T-Bills.

### 4.2 System Stability
Prevents negative rates in crises.
Soaks up "Flight to Quality" cash that has nowhere else to go.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Limits):**
Counterparty limit ($160B per fund).
Market-wide cap.
If limits hit, rates could drop below floor.

**Exercise 2 (QT Accelerator):**
When Fed does QT (lets bonds roll off).
Treasury must issue new bonds to public.
Who buys?
If MMFs buy (using RRP cash) $\implies$ RRP drains. Reserves unchanged. "Benign QT."
If Banks buy (using Reserves) $\implies$ Reserves drain. "Tightening."
