# Quantitative Easing (QE): The Asset Purchase Channel

## I. Executive Summary

**Quantitative Easing** is when a Central Bank buys financial assets (Gov Bonds, MBS, ETFs) from the private sector using newly created reserves. Purpose: To inject liquidity, lower long-term yields, and force investors out of safe assets into riskier assets (Portfolio Rebalance Effect). It is the primary fuel for asset bubbles in the post-2008 and post-COVID eras.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Operation)
Fed buys Bond from Pension Fund ($100M).
Fed credits Pension Fund's Bank with Reserves ($100M).
Bank credits Pension Fund's Deposit ($100M).
Net Result:
-   Fed Balance Sheet +100M.
-   Private Sector holds Cash instead of Bonds.

### Definition 2.2 (Portfolio Rebalance Channel)
Pension Fund now holds Cash (Yield 0%).
It needs 7% return.
It MUST buy Corporate Bonds or Equities.
This drives up Stock Prices and lowers Corporate Yields.
Mechanism: "Forced Risk Taking."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Yield Curve Control (YCC)
Extreme QE.
Targeting specific price for bonds.
"We will buy infinite bonds to keep the 10Y Yield at 0.25%." (BOJ).
This kills the bond market signaling mechanism.

### 3.2 Quantitative Tightening (QT)
The reverse.
Fed lets bonds mature without reinvesting (or sells them).
Reserves vanish.
Liquidity drains.
Risk Assets (Crypto, Tech) crash first.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Don't Fight the Fed
Rule 1 of Macro Trading.
If Fed Balance Sheet is expanding $\implies$ Long S&P 500.
If Fed Balance Sheet is contracting $\implies$ Cash / Short.
Correlation is > 0.9 during QE eras.

### 4.2 Currency Impact
QE = Printing Money = Devaluation?
Usually yes.
US does QE $\implies$ Dollar weakness.
Japan does QE $\implies$ Yen weakness.
Trade: Long EUR/USD if Fed is easing and ECB is hawkish.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Wealth Effect):**
Bernanke's goal: Raise Stock Market $\to$ People feel rich $\to$ People consume $\to$ GDP grows.
Critique: Increases inequality (Rich own stocks, Poor pay inflation).

**Exercise 2 (Taper Tantrum 2013):**
Bernanke merely *hinted* at reducing QE.
Bond Yields spiked 100bps in weeks. Emg Markets crashed.
Lesson: The market is addicted to the "Fed Put." Withdrawal symptoms are violent.
