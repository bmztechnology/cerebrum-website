# London Scheme of Arrangement

## I. Executive Summary

The **Scheme of Arrangement** (Part 26, UK Companies Act) is the British alternative to Chapter 11. It is a **Court-Approved Compromise** between a company and its creditors. Unlike Chapter 11, it is **Not an Insolvency Process** (Directors stay in control, no automatic stay). It is widely used by European companies using **English Law** debt.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Class Composition)
UK Courts are strict.
"Rights" based classing.
If Creditor A has a guarantee and Creditor B doesn't $\implies$ Different Classes.
Creating too many classes (Class proliferation) gives veto power to small groups.
US Chapter 11 is more flexible.

### Definition 2.2 (The Sanction Hearing)
Step 1: Convening Hearing (Define classes).
Step 2: Voting (75% value / 50% number).
Step 3: Sanction Hearing (Judge approves).
Fairness test: "Would a rational creditor act this way?"
Cross-class cramdown (Part 26A) added in 2020.
