# Insider Trading Rules 10b5-1 Plans

## I. Executive Summary

**Insider Trading** is trading based on **Material Non-Public Information (MNPI)**. While illegal for opportunistic trading, executives must liquidate stock. **Rule 10b5-1** provides a "Safe Harbor," allowing insiders to set up pre-planned, automated trading schedules. However, evidence suggests 10b5-1 plans are often abused via **Strategic Cancellation** or **Timing of Adoption**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Material Non-Public Information)
**Material:** Would it change a reasonable investor's decision? (e.g., Merger, Missed Earnings, FDA approval).
**Non-Public:** Has not been disseminated broadly (PR wire).
**Misappropriation Theory:** Using confidential info from an employer for personal gain violates duty of trust.

### Definition 2.2 (10b5-1 Plan Mechanics)
Contract entered into when *not* in possession of MNPI.
Specifies dates, amounts, and prices to sell.
"Sell 5000 shares on the 1st of every month."
Affirmative Defense: "I didn't sell because of the bad earnings; I sold because the auto-plan said so."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Informed vs Liquidity Trading
Insiders are the ultimate "Informed Traders" ($\mu$ in PIN model).
Regulation forces them to become "Liquidity Traders" (Noise) via 10b5-1.
If plans are rigid, Insiders have zero alpha.
If plans are flexible, Insiders retain alpha.

### 3.2 Abuse Patterns
1. **Adopting the plan** right before bad news? (Illegal).
2. **Canceling the plan** right before good news? (Legal Loophole).
   If stock is rising, Insider cancels the sell order.
   "I decided not to sell."
   Retaining the upside based on inside knowledge.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shadow Trading
Insider at Company A knows they will acquire Company B.
Insider buys Company C (Competitor of B).
Securities laws are fuzzy here.
Is non-public info about A material to C?
Yes, due to correlation/sector repricing.

### 4.2 Mosaic Theory
Analysts can trade on "Material" conclusions derived from "Non-Material" public pieces.
Counting cars in parking lot (Public). + Interviewing suppliers (Public). = "Earnings will beat" (Material conclusion).
Legal. This is the job of the analyst.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The CEO Sale):**
CEO sells \$10M stock.
Stock drops 20% next week.
Check filings: "Sale pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 adopted 30 days ago."
Suspicious timing?
SEC now requires "Cooling Off" periods (90 days) to prevent this.

**Exercise 2 (Earnings Blackout):**
Most firms forbid trading 2 weeks before earnings.
10b5-1 plans execute *during* blackout.
This creates a unique flow signal: "Insider Selling during Blackout" $\implies$ purely mechanical.
