# Commercial Paper CP Funding: Unsecured

## I. Executive Summary

**Commercial Paper (CP)** is short-term (1-270 days) unsecured debt issued by high-quality corporations and banks to fund working capital. It is cheaper than bank loans and flexible. The market is tiered by credit quality (**A1/P1** vs **A2/P2**). **Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)** uses conduits to fund receivables, a structure that collapsed during 2008.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The 270 Day Rule)
SEC Act of 1933 exemption.
Debt < 270 days maturity does not require full SEC registration (Prospectus).
Low issuance cost.
Rollover Risk: Must repay or roll every 9 months.

### Definition 2.2 (Backstop Lines)
Rating Agencies require issuers to have Bank Lines of Credit (Liquidity Facility) covering 100% of CP outstanding.
Ensures they can pay if market freezes.
"CP is just a way to arbitrage the difference between Bank Loan rates and Market Rates."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Tiering
-   **Tier 1 (A1/P1):** AA rated. Apple, Toyota. Liquid.
-   **Tier 2 (A2/P2):** A/BBB rated. Illiquid. Higher yield.
-   **Tier 3:** Non-existent. Junk companies cannot issue CP.

### 3.2 The Lehman Shock
Primary Reserve Fund (MMF) held Lehman CP.
Lehman defaulted.
Fund "Broke the Buck" (NAV < $1.00).
Run on MMFs.
Fed had to guarantee CP market (CPFF - Commercial Paper Funding Facility).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Funding Arbitrage
Bank issue CP at 4.0%.
Deposit proceeds at Fed IORB 4.1%.
Free 10bps?
Constraint: Leverage Ratio.

### 4.2 Industrial vs Financial
Financial CP (Banks issuing) is largest segment.
Industrial CP (GE, Ford) is smaller but vital for supply chains.
Direct Issuance (No dealer) vs Dealer Placed.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Days to Maturity):**
Average maturity is 30 days.
Requires constant market access.
During COVID (March 2020), investors refused to buy $> 1$ day CP.
Duration shortened to overnight. Funding crisis.

**Exercise 2 (ABCP Conduits):**
SPV buys Credit Card receivables.
Issues CP to fund them.
Maturity mismatch: Assets (Revolving) vs Liabs (30 days).
If CP doesn't roll, Conduit blows up.
