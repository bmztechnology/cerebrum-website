# Paris Club London Club: Official Sector

## I. Executive Summary

Sovereign restructuring involves two coordination groups. The **Paris Club** represents **Official Creditors** (Governments/Export Credit Agencies). The **London Club** (less formal, now usually Ad-Hoc Committees) represents **Private Creditors** (Banks/Bondholders). The principle of **Comparability of Treatment** ensures conditionality: The Paris Club will only grant relief if the Debtor secures comparable relief from Private Creditors.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Paris Club Terms)
Standardized relief menus:
-   **Naples Terms:** 67% reduction (Poor countries).
-   **Cologne Terms:** 90% (HIPC - Heavily Indebted Poor Countries).
-   **Classic Terms:** Reprofiling (Extension) only. No haircut.

### Definition 2.2 (Cut-off Date)
Date after which new loans are "Post Cut-off."
Post Cut-off debt is Senior. Not subject to restructuring.
Preserves access to trade finance during crisis.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Rise of China
China is not a Paris Club member.
Largest bilateral lender to Emerging Markets (Belt and Road).
Refuses to coordinate? Prefers bilateral opacity.
"Hidden Debt."
Complicates the Comparability of Treatment analysis.

### 3.2 Preferred Creditor Status (PCS)
IMF and World Bank (Multilaterals) are Super-Senior.
They *never* take handouts.
Paris Club is Senior to Private.
Private is Junior.
This hierarchy is being challenged in modern restructurings (Zambia, Ghana).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Moral Suasion
Paris Club members (US, France, Germany) pressure their banks to coordinate.
Historical "London Club" meetings in bank boardrooms.
Now, bondholders are dispersed (Thousands of retail/HF accounts). Harder to herd.

### 4.2 Creditor Committees
ICMA guidelines.
Bondholders form a Steering Committee.
Advisors (Lazard, Rothschild) and Lawyers (Cleary, White & Case) negotiate the deal.
Who pays the fees? The Debtor (Sovereign).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (HIPC Initiative):**
Systematic wipeout of debt for poorest nations (2000s).
Result: Clean balance sheets.
Outcome: They borrowed heavily again (2010-2020) from China and Bond markets.
Cycle repeats.

**Exercise 2 (The Veto):**
Can Paris Club block an IMF program?
"Lending into Arrears" policy.
IMF can lend even if Official Creditors are unpaid, provided "Good Faith" negotiations are happening.
