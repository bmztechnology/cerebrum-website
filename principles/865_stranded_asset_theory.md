# Stranded Asset Theory

## I. Executive Summary

**Stranded Assets** are investments that suffer from unanticipated or premature write-downs due to **Transition Risks** (Regulatory change, Tech disruption). The prime example is **Fossil Fuel Reserves**. The valuation model shifts from DCF of perpetual extraction to a **Run-off Model** (extract fast before ban). Microstructure involves **Divestment Flows** increasing the **Cost of Capital** for dirty industries.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Unburnable Carbon)
Carbon Budget to stay under 2C warming: 1000 Gt.
Proven Reserves on Balance Sheets: 3000 Gt.
Result: 2/3 of Reserves cannot be burned.
Value on Balance Sheet = \$Trillions.
Value in reality = 0 (Stranded).
"Carbon Bubble."

### Definition 2.2 (Cost of Capital Wedge)
$WACC_{Green} < WACC_{Brown}$.
Green: 5%. Brown: 12%.
Brown projects become NPV negative.
Market mechanism to choke supply.
Counter-argument: High WACC $\implies$ High required return $\implies$ Less Capex $\implies$ Supply shortage $\implies$ High Oil Price $\implies$ Brown companies make record profits (2022).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Orderly vs Disorderly Transition
**Orderly:** Gradual carbon tax. Asset values decline smoothly. Depletion matches demand drop.
**Disorderly:** Sudden ban. Panic. Fire sale of assets. Financial stability crisis.
Central Banks (NGFS) stress test banks for Disorderly scenarios.

### 3.2 Liability Stranding
Coal plant not only worthless ($Asset = 0$) but negative ($Liability > 0$).
Cleanup costs (remediation).
Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO).
Companies try to "Spin off" dirty assets to weak entities to avoid cleanup costs.
"Bad Bank" model for Carbon.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Dividend Recap Strategy
If you are a Coal Miner.
Market values you at 2x earnings (Terminal decline).
Strategy: Stop Capex. Maximize Cash Flow. Pay 50% Dividends.
"Harvesting" the asset before it strands.
Rational endgame behavior.

### 4.2 Coal-to-Solar Switch
Valuation arbitrage.
Coal site has: Grid Connection + Land + Water license.
Replace turbine with Solar/Battery.
Reuse the Grid Connection (The scarcest asset).
"Brownfield Redevelopment."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (ICE Vehicles):**
Internal Combustion Engine factories.
Stranded by 2035 bans?
Accelerated Depreciation on financials.
Hits Earnings Per Share (EPS).

**Exercise 2 (Real Estate Risk):**
Office building with EPC Rating 'F'.
Regulation: Cannot rent 'F' rated buildings by 2030.
Capex to upgrade > Value of building.
Stranded Asset.
"Brown Discount" in property markets.
