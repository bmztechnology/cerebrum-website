# Commodity Currencies AUD CAD NOK

## I. Executive Summary

**Commodity Currencies** (Terms of Trade currencies) are tightly coupled to the export prices of their nations. **AUD** (Iron Ore/Gold), **CAD** (Oil), and **NOK** (Oil/Gas) act as **liquid proxies** for commodity exposure. Microstructure involves **Real Money** flows (Exporters selling USD/Buying local ccy) and **Speculative** flows (Carry Trades/Macro bets).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Terms of Trade - ToT)
$$ ToT = \frac{Export Price Index}{Import Price Index} $$
If Export prices (Oil) rise, ToT improves.
National Income rises.
Currency appreciates to balance the trade surplus.
AUD/USD correlation with Iron Ore $\approx$ 0.8.
USD/CAD inverse correlation with Oil $\approx$ 0.75.

### Definition 2.2 (The Petrodollar Recycling)
Oil Exporter earns USD.
Capital Account: Invests USD in Treasuries or Global Assets (Sovereign Wealth Fund - Norway Norges Bank).
Does not necessarily repatriate to NOK immediately.
Dampens the currency appreciation via smart FW reserves management.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Dutch Disease
Resource boom causes currency spike.
Manufacturing exports become uncompetitve.
Economy hollows out.
Central Bank may intervene to sell currency (Buying USD reserves) to protect manufacturing.
"Leaning against the wind."

### 3.2 Interest Rate Differential
Resource boom $\implies$ Inflation $\implies$ Central Bank Hikes Rates.
High Rates attract Carry Trade.
Double Boost: Trade Flow + Capital Flow.
Super-cycle appreciation (e.g., AUD 2000-2011).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Cross-Rate Play
Long AUD / Short CAD.
Betting on: Iron Ore > Oil. Or China > US.
Isolating the specific commodity drivers while neutralizing the USD factor.

### 4.2 Proxy Hedging
Airline wants to hedge Fuel.
Oil Futures limits are tight / expensive collateral.
Short USD/CAD?
Imperfect hedge (Basis risk).
But deeply liquid and capital efficient.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Chilean Peso - CLP):**
Copper proxy.
Daily interaction between CODELCO (State miner) and FX market.
Copper crash $\implies$ CLP crash.
Political risk (Constitution rewrite) adds noise.

**Exercise 2 (Safe Haven Commodities?):**
CHF (Swiss Franc).
Not a resource exporter. But huge Gold refining/holding hub.
High correlation with Gold?
Yes, but driven by "Safety" factor shared by both Gold and CHF.
