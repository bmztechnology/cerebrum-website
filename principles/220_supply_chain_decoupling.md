# Supply Chain Decoupling: The End of Globalization

## I. Executive Summary

**Decoupling** (or De-risking) is the reversal of Globalization. For 30 years, efficiency (Just-In-Time) ruled. Now, resilience (Just-In-Case) rules. Nations are moving supply chains closer to home (**Near-shoring**) or to political allies (**Friend-shoring**). The epicenter of this risk is the Semiconductor industry (Taiwan/TSMC).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Globalization Peak)
Occurred roughly 2008-2012.
Trade-to-GDP ratio has flatlined since.
Drivers of reversal:
1.  Wage Arbitrage closing (Chinese wages rose).
2.  Geopolitical Rivalry (US vs China).
3.  Pandemic Shock (Fragility exposed).

### Definition 2.2 (The Chip War)
Semiconductors are the "Oil" of the 21st century.
TSMC (Taiwan) makes 90% of advanced chips.
US "CHIPS Act": Subsidize domestic fabs ($52B).
US Export Controls: Ban selling advanced chips/equipment (ASML) to China.
Goal: Retain technological primacy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Efficiency vs Robustness Frontier
Old Optima: Minimum Inventory, Lowest Cost Source (China). Fragile.
New Optima: Strategic Buffer Inventory, Diversified Sources (Vietnam, Mexico). Expensive.
Result: Structural Inflation (Cost of resilience).

### 3.2 The Kindleberger Trap
When the Hegemon (US) stops providing global public goods (Open Markets) and starts acting mercantalist.
Global system fragments.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Mexico Play
Near-shoring winner.
Tesla building Gigafactory in Mexico.
Long MXN (Peso).
"The China of the West."

### 4.2 Inflationary Impact
Decoupling is inherently inflationary.
We are intentionally moving production from Low Cost (China) to High Cost (US/Europe).
Central Banks will struggle to hit 2% target.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Apple):**
Trying to move iPhone production to India.
Takes 10 years to replicate the Shenzhen ecosystem.
Sticky Supply Chains.

**Exercise 2 (Rare Earths):**
China controls 80% of processing.
Decoupling requires building dirty refineries in the West.
Environmental Regulation (ESG) vs National Security.
Security wins.
