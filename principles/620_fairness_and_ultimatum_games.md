# Fairness and Ultimatum Games

## I. Executive Summary

Standard economics assumes agents maximize profit. **Ultimatum Games** prove agents value **Fairness** enough to punish "unfair" offers, even at a personal financial cost. In markets, perceptions of fairness (e.g., High Frequency Trading front-running, Insider Trading) impact participation and liquidity. A market perceived as "Rigged" loses its social license.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Ultimatum Game)
Proposer splits \$10.
Responder accepts (Split happens) or Rejects (Both get \$0).
Rational Proposer offers \$0.01. Rational Responder accepts (Penny > 0).
Actual: Offers < \$3 are rejected.
Responder pays cost to punish unfairness ("Altruistic Punishment").

### Definition 2.2 (Inequity Aversion)
Fehr & Schmidt.
Utility function penalizes inequality.
$U_i = x_i - \alpha(x_j - x_i)$ if $x_j > x_i$ (Envy).
Explains rage against CEO pay or Bailouts.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Market Microstructure Fairness
Flash Boys (Lewis).
HFT front-running order flow.
Institutional investors felt "cheated."
Move to IEX (Speed bump exchange).
Fairness is a marketable product attribute.

### 3.2 Bailouts and Moral Hazard
2008 Bailouts.
Main Street (Responder) saw Wall Street (Proposer) getting 100%.
Political backlash (Occupy Wall Street / Tea Party).
Loss of faith in capitalism.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 ESG as Fairness
Investors demanding "Fair Wages" in supply chain.
Not just charity.
Unfair practices lead to strikes, regulation, brand damage.
Pricing "Social Risk."

### 4.2 Salary Negotiations
"Anchor high" works, but "Insultingly high" triggers rejection.
The offer must fall within the "Zone of Fairness."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Dictator Game):**
Same as Ultimatum, but Responder cannot reject.
Proposers give much less ($\approx$ 0-10%).
Fairness is driven partly by fear of rejection (Strategic Fairness) vs pure altruism.

**Exercise 2 (Insider Trading):**
Victimless crime?
No, it destroys the "Level Playing Field" illusion.
Without that illusion, retail liquidity exits.
Cost of capital rises.
