# The Regulatory State Dodd Frank and Basel

## I. Executive Summary

The Financial System is a public-private partnership. **Regulation** (Dodd-Frank, Basel III, MiFID II) defines the constraints. The synthesis argues that Regulation acts as **Architecture**: it forces banks to hold capital (Safety), pushes derivates to CCPs (Transparency), and bans Prop Trading (Volcker). Market Structure is the **Shadow of Regulation**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Basel III Capital Stack)
**CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1):** Pure Equity. Loss absorbing.
**AT1 (Additional Tier 1):** CoCo Bonds. Convert to equity in crisis.
**Tier 2:** Subordinated Debt.
Key Ratio: $CET1 / RWA > 4.5\% (plus buffers \approx 10\%)$.
Limits Bank Leverage. Reduces ROE.

### Definition 2.2 (The Volcker Rule)
"Banks cannot trade for their own account."
Separates Utility Banking (Lending) from Casino Banking (Prop Trading).
Result: Banks shut down Prop desks.
Liquidity transferred to Hedge Funds (Citadel/Jane Street).
Market Making inventory at banks dropped.
Bond market more fragile?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regulatory Capture
Stigler.
Regulators are captured by the Industry they regulate.
Revolving Door (SEC $\to$ Goldman $\to$ SEC).
Result: Complex rules that favor incumbents (Barriers to Entry).
Small banks assume compliance costs are fixed $\implies$ Consolidation ("Too Small to Succeed").

### 3.2 The Water Balloon Theory
Squeeze risk in Banks (Basel).
Risk pops out in Non-Banks (Private Credit).
Systemic Risk is conserved, not destroyed.
Just moved to the shadows.
Regulators now eyeing "Non-Bank SIFI" designation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Capital Relief Trades (CRT)
Bank buys guarantee from Hedge Fund to reduce RWA.
Regulatory Arb.
Optimizes the Basel constraint.

### 4.2 Best Execution (MiFID II)
Must prove to client you got the best price.
Unbundling "Research" from "Execution" (Hard Dollars).
Killed the Soft Dollar ecosystem.
Reduced coverage of Small Caps (No commission to pay analysts).
Unintended consequence: Less liquidity in Small Caps.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Credit Suisse AT1 Wipeout):**
Swiss Regulator wrote down AT1 bonds to Zero.
But Equity got some value?
Violated Absolute Priority Rule.
Market panic.
Regulatory discretion vs Rule of Law.

**Exercise 2 (Whistleblower Alpha):**
SEC pays 10-30% of fine to Whistleblower.
Incentivizes insiders to report fraud.
Externalizing enforcement.
