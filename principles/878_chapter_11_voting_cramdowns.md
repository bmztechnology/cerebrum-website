# Chapter 11 Voting and Cramdowns

## I. Executive Summary

**Chapter 11 Bankruptcy** is a negotiation, not a liquidation. The goal is a **Plan of Reorganization (POR)**. The microstructure revolves around **Voting Classes**: Secured, Unsecured, Equity. A **Cramdown** allows the court to approve a plan even if an impaired class rejects it, provided it meets the "Fair and Equitable" test (Absolute Priority Rule).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Classes)
**Secured:** Have collateral. Usually reinstated or paid in full (or given the collateral).
**Unsecured (GUCs):** Trade creditors, Bondholders. Usually impaired (get pennies).
**Equity:** Usually wiped out (Option value = 0).
**Voting Rule:** Plan needs acceptance by at least one Impaired Class (2/3 in amount, 1/2 in number).

### Definition 2.2 (The Cramdown)
Section 1129(b).
If Class A accepts, but Class B rejects.
Court can "Cram down" value on Class B.
Condition: Class B cannot receive less than liquidation value. And no class *junior* to B (e.g., Equity) can receive anything unless B is paid in full.
"Absolute Priority Rule."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Gifting (Class Skipping)
Secured Lenders (Senior) agree to give a "Gift" (Tip) to Equity holders to get them to cooperate and speed up the case.
Bypasses the Unsecured Creditors (Middle class).
Legal controversy: "Does the Absolute Priority Rule apply to private gifts?"
Courts are split.

### 3.2 The Fulcrum Security
The class where value runs out.
Senior Debt: 100% Recovery.
Sub Debt: 20% Recovery. (Fulcrum).
Equity: 0%.
The Fulcrum class gets the New Equity in the reorganized company.
"Loan-to-Own" strategy targets the Fulcrum.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Blocking Position
You need 2/3 of amount to carry a class.
You need 1/3 + \$1 to *block* a class.
Vulture Fund buys 34% of the bonds.
"The Blocking Stake."
Demands better terms to release the vote.
Greenmail in bankruptcy.

### 4.2 Death Trap Provision
"Vote YES, and you get Warrants."
"Vote NO, and you get nothing."
 coercive voting mechanics.
Prisoner's dilemma for creditors.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Vote Designation):**
Competitor buys bonds to vote "NO" and kill the company (force liquidation).
Court can "Designate" (Disqualify) their vote for "Bad Faith."
Strategic antitrust behavior.

**Exercise 2 (Artificial Impairment):**
Debtor impairs a friendly class intentionally (e.g., pays vendors 99 cents on the dollar).
Vendors vote YES.
Requirement for "One Impaired Class" met.
Allows cramdown on the hostile Bondholders.
Manufacturing consent.
