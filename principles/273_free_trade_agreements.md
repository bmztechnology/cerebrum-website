# Free Trade Agreements: Rules of Origin

## I. Executive Summary

**Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)** like USMCA (NAFTA 2.0) and EU Single Market eliminate tariffs between members. However, to prevent "Transshipment" (e.g., China shipping to Mexico to enter US duty-free), strict **Rules of Origin (ROO)** are enforced. These rules dictate what percentage of a product must be "made" within the bloc.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Regional Value Content - RVC)
Formula:
$$RVC = \frac{Net Cost - Value of Non-Originating Materials}{Net Cost} \times 100$$
USMCA Auto Rule: 75% of a car must be made in North America to be zero-tariff.
Requires deep supply chain auditing.

### Definition 2.2 (Trade Creation vs Diversion - Viner)
-   **Trade Creation:** Low cost member replaces high cost domestic production. Good.
-   **Trade Diversion:** High cost member (Mexico) replaces Low cost non-member (China) just because of tariff preference. Bad.
FTAs are "Second Best" to Global Free Trade.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Spaghetti Bowl Effect (Bhagwati)
Hundreds of bilateral FTAs.
Each has different ROO.
Compliance costs explode.
Companies often ignore the FTA and pay the MFN tariff just to avoid the paperwork.
"Utilization Rates" of FTAs are often < 50%.

### 3.2 Deep Integration
Modern FTAs are not just about Tariffs (which are already low).
They are about Regulations, IP, Labor Standards, Environment.
USMCA forced Mexico to recognize Independent Labor Unions (to raise Mexican wages and stop undercutting US workers).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Mexico Play
With USMCA + China Tariffs.
Mexico is the perfect backdoor.
Chinese companies building factories in Monterrey (Mexico).
"Near-shoring."
Long MXN (Peso) and Mexican Industrial Real Estate (FIBRA).

### 4.2 Brexit Non-Tariff Barriers
UK left EU Customs Union.
Tariff-free trade remained (TCA).
BUT, Customs Checks, ROO paperwork, Vet checks.
Friction costs $\approx$ 5-10% tariff equivalent.
Small exporters quit market.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tariff Shift Method):**
Alternative to RVC.
Change in Tariff Classification.
Import: Steel (Chapter 72).
Process: Stamp into Fender (Chapter 87).
Transformation occurred. Origin conferred.
Simpler than value-add calc.

**Exercise 2 (Cumulation):**
Bilateral Cumulation.
US parts used in Mexico count as "Mexican" content when exporting back to US.
Encourages supply chain integration.
