# The Death of Cash

## I. Executive Summary

**Cash** (Physical Currency) is arguably the last vestige of **Financial Privacy** and **Offline Resilience**. Its decline is driven by **Efficiency** (Contactless), **E-Commerce**, and **State Desire for Control** (Tax Evasion/Crime). The synthesis warns that while a Cashless Society is efficient, it is **Fragile** (Cyberattack/Power Grid) and **Coercive**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Gresham's Law Inversed)
Original: "Bad money drives out good."
Digital: "Convenient money drives out private money."
Consumers prefer the 1-second delay of Apple Pay over the 10-second delay of change counting.
The "Convenience Yield" of digital > The "Privacy Yield" of cash.

### Definition 2.2 (Financial Exclusion)
Unbanked population depends on cash.
If shops stop accepting cash (Sweden), the poor are excluded from the economy.
"Access to Digital Payment" becomes a human right?
Or does Cash become a "Legacy Protocol" supported by the state?

## III. Theoretical Framework
