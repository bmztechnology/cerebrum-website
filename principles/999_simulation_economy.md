# The Simulation Economy

## I. Executive Summary

As computational power grows, **Virtual Economies** become larger than the physical economy. Eventually, if we live in a simulation, "Finance" becomes the management of **Computational Resources**. The ultimate scarce resource is not gold or land, but **CPU Cycles** and **Memory**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Computational Scarcity)
In a simulation, atoms are just data structures.
The limit on "stuff" is the RAM of the host machine.
Cost of a good = Complexity of rendering it.
A diamond is "cheap" (simple crystal lattice).
A living flower is "expensive" (complex biological simulation).

### Definition 2.2 (The Rendering Horizon)
The economy only exists where observers are looking.
"Just-in-Time" reality.
Financial markets optimize the allocation of rendering power to where it provides the most utility to the User.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The MMO Model
Lessons from EVE Online, World of Warcraft.
Hyper-inflation (gold farming).
Soulbound Tokens (items that cannot be traded).
The blurred line between "Play" and "Work" (Play-to-Earn models).

### 3.2 Substrate Independence
Value is not attached to the physical medium (silicon vs biological neurons).
Value is attached to the **Pattern**.
Uploading consciousness: The ultimate asset transfer.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Designing Incentives for AIs
If the workforce is digital, money is just a reward function / objective function.
Hyper-capitalism at machine speed.
Algorithmic trading is the proto-simulation economy.

### 4.2 Escape Velocity
Accumulating enough resources in the simulation to buy influence in the Base Reality.
The "Breakout" strategy.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Polygon Budget):**
You have a budget of 1 Trillion polygons per frame.
Allocate them to maximize User Happiness. This is the new "Central Banking."

**Exercise 2 (Glitch Arbitrage):**
Exploiting physics engine bugs for profit.
Is this "Illegal" or just "High Frequency Trading" in a new form?
