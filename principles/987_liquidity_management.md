# Liquidity Management

## I. Executive Summary

**Liquidity** is the ability to convert an asset to cash without moving the price. **Liquidity Management** is the lifeblood of survival. Most funds die not from bad ideas, but from a **Liquidity Mismatch** (Holding illiquid assets with liquid liabilities). The synthesis emphasizes **Cash Buffers**, **Gate Mechanisms**, and **liquidity-adjusted sizing** as the final defense.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cost of Liquidity)
Bid-Ask Spread + Market Impact.
In crisis, Spread widens, Impact explodes (Depth vanishes).
"Liquidity Black Hole."
Cost to exit a large position can exceed the potential profit.
"Crowded Trades."

### Definition 2.2 (ALM - Asset Liability Management)
Banks: Liabilities = Demand Deposits (Instant). Assets = Mortgages (30 Years).
Mismatch.
Run on Bank $\implies$ Insolvency.
Hedge Funds: Liabilities = Monthly Redemptions. Assets = Private Equity?
Side Pockets.
Matching the "Duration of Capital" to the "Duration of Assets."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Liquidity Cascade
Sell-off triggers margin calls.
Leveraged players sell liquid assets (Gold, Apple) to pay for illiquid losses.
Contagion.
"Correlations go to 1."
Everything falls except the Dollar.

### 3.2 Cash is an Option
Holding Cash (0% real return) feels painful.
But Cash is a "Call Option on every asset class at a crash price."
Buffett's \$100B cash pile.
The ability to act when others are forced to sell.
Strategic Liquidity.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Capturing the Illiquidity Premium
Buying illiquid assets (PE/Real Estate) earns higher return.
"Payment for locking up capital."
Strategy: Harvard Endowment Model.
Lock up capital for 10 years. Harvest premium.
Risk: 2008. Harvard needed cash, couldn't sell timberland. Had to sell liquid stocks at bottom.

### 4.2 Redemption Gates
"You can only withdraw 25% per quarter."
Prevents run on the fund.
Protects remaining investors from fire sales.
Hated by investors, loved by managers.
Essential for distress strategies.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Woodford Blowup):**
Neil Woodford (UK).
Daily liquidity fund.
Bought illiquid unlisted startups.
Redemptions came.
Couldn't sell startups.
Gated.
Fund collapsed.
Violation of Rule #1: Don't put illiquid assets in a liquid wrapper.

**Exercise 2 (Sizing for Exit):**
"I can buy \$10M of this small cap."
"But can I sell it?"
If trading 10% of Daily Volume, takes 10 days to exit.
Price will drop 20%.
Position size limited by Liquidity, not Conviction.
