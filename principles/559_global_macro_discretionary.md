# Global Macro Discretionary: The Big Picture

## I. Executive Summary

**Global Macro** funds trade any liquid asset class (Currencies, Rates, Equities, Commodities) based on systemic shifts in global economies, government policies, and geopolitical events. Unlike bottom-up stock pickers, Macro managers are Top-Down. They bet on **Central Bank divergences**, **Fiscal imbalances**, and **Currency regimes**. The strategy is characterized by high liquidity and the ability to profit from massive directional moves (Soros breaking the Bank of England).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Soros Reflexivity)
Market prices affect fundamentals, which in turn affect prices.
Feedback loops.
Bubbles and busts are endogenous.
Macro traders exploit the "Far from Equilibrium" states.

### Definition 2.2 (The Kari Trade vs Change)
Carry: Profiting from static spreads (Long High Yield FX / Short Low Yield FX).
Change: Profiting from regime shifts (Rate hike cycle begins).
Macro managers switch between these modes.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Impossible Trinity (Mundell-Fleming)
A country cannot simultaneously have:
1.  Fixed Exchange Rate.
2.  Free Capital Flow.
3.  Independent Monetary Policy.
When a country tries (e.g., ERM Crisis, Asian Crisis), Macro funds attack the peg.

### 3.2 Convexity in Macro
Using Options for macro bets.
Long OTM Puts on a currency peg.
Loss: Limited (Premium).
Gain: Asymmetric (Devaluation).
"Asymmetric Risk/Reward" is the holy grail.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Rates Trade
Curve Steepeners vs Flatteners.
If Fed cuts rates: Front end rallies (Yield drops).
Trade: Long 2Y-Treasuries vs Short 10Y-Treasuries (Steepener).

### 4.2 FX Wars
Competitive Devaluation.
Long USD vs Short EMP (Emerging Markets).
Flight to safety dynamics.
"Risk On / Risk Off."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Breakeven Inflation):**
Long TIPS / Short Nominal Treasuries.
Pure bet on inflation expectations rising.
Mechanics of the spread.

**Exercise 2 (The Widowmaker):**
Shorting JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds).
Decades of traders lost money betting rates *must* rise in Japan.
"Don't fight the BOJ."
