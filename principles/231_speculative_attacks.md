# Speculative Attacks: Breaking the Bank

## I. Executive Summary

A **Speculative Attack** occurs when investors relentlessly sell a currency to force a devaluation, betting that the Central Bank will run out of reserves before the market runs out of selling power. The archetype is **George Soros vs Bank of England (Black Wednesday 1992)**. Identifying the "Inconsistency" in the peg is the key to identifying the target.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (First Generation Model - Krugman)
Attack caused by fundamental inconsistency.
Fiscal Deficit + Fixed Exchange Rate.
Govt prints money to fund deficit.
Central Bank sells reserves to buy back money (to fix rate).
Reserves eventually hit zero.
Peg collapses.
Rational Speculators attack *before* reserves hit zero (Backward induction).

### Definition 2.2 (Second Generation Model - Obstfeld)
Attack is self-fulfilling.
Fundamentals are okay, but not great.
If Speculators attack $\to$ Central Bank must hike rates to 50% to defend.
High rates crush economy $\to$ Govt gives up Peg to save Economy.
The attack *caused* the weakness that justified the attack.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Soros Trade
GBP joined ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism) at too high a rate.
German rates were high (Reunification). UK needed low rates (Recession).
Inconsistency: UK cannot have high rates.
Soros Shorted GBP.
BOE bought GBP. Solvency Limit.
BOE hiked to 15%. Pain too high.
BOE Exit. GBP Crash. Soros +$1B.

### 3.2 Interest Rate Defense
Why not hike to 1000%?
Because it kills the banking system (Short-term funding rates).
Speculators know the "Pain Threshold" of the Central Bank.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Assessing Vulnerability
1.  Overvalued Real Exchange Rate (Imports cheap, Industry hurting).
2.  Low FX Reserves (Import Cover < 3 months).
3.  Weak Banking System (Cannot tolerate high rates).
4.  Political Elections (Cannot tolerate austerity).
If 4/4 $\implies$ Short Currency.

### 4.2 The Double Play
Short Currency + Long Stocks?
No. Short Currency + Short Stocks (Interest rate defense kills stocks).
After Devaluation: Long Stocks (Export boom).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Asian Crisis 1997):**
Thailand Pegged Baht to USD.
Dollar strengthened. Baht became overvalued.
Exports slowed.
Soros attacked.
Thailand ran out of dollars. Devalued 50%.

**Exercise 2 (Swiss Franc 2015):**
Speculators were Long CHF (attacking the *ceiling*).
SNB was selling CHF (Printing).
Unlike defending a floor (limited reserves), defending a ceiling (printing) is infinite.
But SNB stopped because the Balance Sheet got too big (Political limit).
