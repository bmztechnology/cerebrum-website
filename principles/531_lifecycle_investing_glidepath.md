# Lifecycle Investing Glidepath: Human Capital

## I. Executive Summary

**Lifecycle Investing** integrates **Human Capital** (the present value of future earnings) into the asset allocation decision. Young investors have high Human Capital (bond-like, if employed stably) and low Financial Capital. Therefore, Financial Capital should be 100% Equity. As they age, Human Capital depletes, and Financial Capital grows, necessitating a shift (Glidepath) toward Bonds to replace the bond-like safety of wages.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Total Wealth)
$$ TotalWealth = FinancialCapital + HumanCapital $$
$HC = \sum \frac{Wages}{(1+r)^t}$.
Asset Allocation should optimize risk of **Total Wealth**.
If HC is "Bond-Like" (Tenured Professor), Total Wealth is 90% Bonds.
To enable 60/40 Total Wealth structure, Financial Capital must be $>100\%$ Equity (Leverage).
"Ayres-Nalebuff" strategy: Young people should buy stocks on margin (2:1).

### Definition 2.2 (The Glidepath)
Equity Allocation vs Age.
"To 35" $\to$ 100% or 90%.
"To 65" $\to$ Declines to 50%.
"Through 65" $\to$ Continues declining in retirement? Or constant?
Linear or Curvilinear.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Human Capital Correlations
Stockbroker: HC correlated with Market (Bonus vanishes in crash). HC is "Equity-like." Should hold LESS stock.
Teacher: HC uncorrelated. HC is "Bond-like." Should hold MORE stock.
Correlation of Wages to Risky Assets determines the optimal starting allocation.

### 3.2 Sequence of Returns Risk
Retirement Red Zone (5 years before/after retirement).
Portfolio is largest. HC is gone.
Market crash here is devastating.
Glidepath aims to minimize risk specifically in this zone.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Target Date Funds (TDF)
"Set it and forget it."
Vanguard 2065 Fund.
Automated Glidepath.
Critique: "One size fits all." Does not account for individual HC risk or Pension wealth.

### 4.2 Bond Tent
Rise in equity until age 55? No.
allocating to bonds *specifically* at retirement date (The Tent Peak).
Then increasing equity *after* retirement? (Rising Equity Glidepath).
Logic: Reducing sequence risk early in retirement is paramount. Later on, mortality risk allows more equity.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The 100 minus Age Rule):**
Equity % = 100 - Age.
30 year old $\to$ 70%.
Old school.
Modern life expectancy (90) implies this is too conservative.
Updated: 120 - Age.

**Exercise 2 (Social Security):**
Govt guaranteed inflation-indexed annuity.
Bond-like asset.
If Social Security covers basic needs, Financial Portfolio can remain 100% Equity forever?
Floor-Upside framework.
