# Choice Architecture Defaults

## I. Executive Summary

**Choice Architecture** focuses on the structural design of decision-making environments. The **Default Option** is the most potent tool: since humans suffer from **Inertia** (Status Quo Bias), the path of least resistance determines the outcome for the majority. Designing the "Menu" (Number of options, ordering, categorization) dictates flow in everything from 401k Plans to algo-trading dashboards.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Paradox of Choice)
More options $\neq$ Better decisions.
Lyengar (Jam Study).
24 Jams displayed $\implies$ 3% bought.
6 Jams displayed $\implies$ 30% bought.
Choice Overload leads to Analysis Paralysis.
In 401ks, for every 10 funds added, participation drops 2%.

### Definition 2.2 (Structuring)
Grouping options matters.
Menu: "Fruit" vs "Cake."
If you break Cake into "Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry" and Fruit is just "Fruit", people pick Cake (1/N heuristic).
"Partitioning Dependence."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Required Choice
No default?
"Active Choice."
User *must* pick Yes or No to proceed.
Forces System 2 engagement.
Better than Opt-In, but higher cognitive load/friction.

### 3.2 Map and Match
Mapping choices to welfare.
"Gold Plan" vs "Silver Plan." (Metal labels imply value).
Mapping complex attributes (Deductibles, Co-pays) into simple metrics (Estimated Annual Cost).
Good architecture bridges the gap.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Robo-Advisor Onboarding
Risk Questionnaire.
How questions are ordered.
Resulting Portfolio recommendation.
"Do you want to override our recommendation?" (Friction).
95% accept the recommendation (Default).

### 4.2 Algorithmic Execution
Default algo: VWAP.
Easy. Safe.
Trader has to work to choose "Implementation Shortfall."
VWAP becomes the liquidity magnet due to interface design.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Categorization Bias):**
Ask people to allocate across: "US Equities, Intl Equities, Bonds." Result: 33/33/33.
Ask people to allocate across: "Growth, Value, Small Cap, Intl, Bonds." Result: 20/20/20/20/20.
Equity allocation jumps from 66% to 80% just by breaking down the Equity category.

**Exercise 2 (Organ Donation):**
Presumed Consent (Opt-Out).
Highest donation rates.
Ethical debate: Does silence equal consent?
In finance: Does silence equal "Keep my money in the low-yield sweep account"?
