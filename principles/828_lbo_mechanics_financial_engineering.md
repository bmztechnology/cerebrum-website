# LBO Mechanics and Financial Engineering

## I. Executive Summary

**Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)** involve acquiring a company using a small amount of Equity (30%) and a large amount of Debt (70%), which is placed on the target's balance sheet. The returns are generated by **Deleveraging** (paying down debt with cash flow), **Operational Improvement** (EBITDA growth), and **Multiple Expansion**. Microstructure focuses on the **Debt Stack** (Senior/Junior) and the **Tax Shield**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The LBO Return Driver Formula)
$$ \text{Equity Value}_{Exit} = (\text{EBITDA}_{Exit} \times \text{Multiple}_{Exit}) - \text{Net Debt}_{Exit} $$
Sources of Alpha:
1.  $\Delta$ EBITDA (Operational).
2.  $\Delta$ Multiple (Market timing).
3.  $\Delta$ Net Debt (Free Cash Flow paydown).
Financial Engineering = Maximizing 3.

### Definition 2.2 (The Debt Tax Shield)
Interest payments are tax-deductible.
LBO replaces Equity (Dividends not deductible) with Debt (Interest deductible).
WACC decreases.
Value of Firm increases by $PV(\text{Tax Shield})$.
This "Transfer of value from Gov to Shareholders" is the core arbitrage of the LBO.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Agency Cost of Free Cash Flow
Jensen's Hypothesis.
Public managers with excess cash waste it on "Empire Building" (bad acquisitions, jets).
LBO Debt forces discipline.
"Cash flow must go to interest, not jets."
Debt is a governance mechanism.

### 3.2 Dividend Recaps
PE Firm owns company for 3 years.
Company performs well.
Instead of selling, PE forces company to borrow more.
Uses proceeds to pay a special dividend to PE Firm.
"Taking chips off the table" while keeping the equity.
Increases bankruptcy risk for the company.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Roll-Up Strategy
Buy a Platform Company (e.g., Dentist chain) at 10x EBITDA.
Buy 50 mom-and-pop dentists at 4x EBITDA.
Integrate them.
Sell the whole chain at 12x EBITDA.
Multiple Arbitrage + Synergies.
Standard PE playbook.

### 4.2 Distressed Debt Control
Buy the Debt of a struggling company at 50 cents on the dollar.
Block restructuring.
Force bankruptcy.
Convert Debt to Equity (Fulcrum Security).
Take control of the company for cheap.
"Loan-to-Own."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (IRR Sensitivity):**
Entry: 10x. Leverage: 6x.
Scenario A: Exit 10x. 20% IRR.
Scenario B: Exit 8x. 5% IRR.
LBOs are highly sensitive to Exit Multiples.
"Multiple Creep" risk.

**Exercise 2 (Covenant-Lite Loans):**
Bull market phenomena.
Lenders waive maintenance covenants (e.g., Max Leverage ratio).
Allows PE firms to run higher leverage without defaulting.
"Zombies" stay alive longer.
