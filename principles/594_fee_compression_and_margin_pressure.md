# Fee Compression and Margin Pressure

## I. Executive Summary

**Fee Compression** is the secular trend of declining asset management fees, driven by **Passive Investing** (Race to Zero), **Regulatory Transparency** (MiFID II), and **Technology**. The traditional "1% AUM" model is under attack. The industry is bifurcating: **Scale Beta** (Vanguard, BlackRock) at 3bps, and **High Alpha** (Hedge Funds/PE) at "2 and 20." The "Mushy Middle" (Active Long Only at 80bps) is dying.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Operating Margin)
Asset Management historically had 30-40% margins.
Now shrinking.
Scale is the only defense.
M&A wave: (Franklin Templeton buying Legg Mason).
Cost synergies = firing analysts.

### Definition 2.2 (Zero Fee Funds)
Fidelity Zero Funds.
Loss leader.
Make money on: 1. Securities Lending. 2. Cash Sweep. 3. Cross-selling advice.
Asset Management becomes a feature, not a product.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Barbell
Assets flowing to:
Left: Ultra-cheap Beta (ETFs).
Right: High-cost Illiquid Alpha (Private Equity).
Center: Active Mutual Funds (Outflows).
"There is no value proposition in expensive Beta."

### 3.2 Value for Money
Regulators (FCA) requiring "Assessment of Value" reports.
Justify your fee.
If you hug the index, you must lower fees.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Performance Based Fees
Fulcrum Fees.
Base fee (low) + Perf fee (if beat benchmark).
Aligns interest.
Common in Institutional, rare in Retail (due to complexity).

### 4.2 ETF Conversion
converting Mutual Funds to ETFs to lower cost and tax drag.
Desperate attempt to retain assets.
Direct Indexing as the ultimate fee killer.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Break-even AUM):**
Fixed costs = \$5M/year.
Fee = 50bps.
Need \$1B AUM to break even.
Most funds are zombie funds.

**Exercise 2 (Active Share):**
Metric of how different a portfolio is from benchmark.
High Active Share justifies higher fee.
Low Active Share = "Closet Index."
