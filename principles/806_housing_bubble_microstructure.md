# Housing Bubble Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

**Housing Bubbles** are driven by a feedback loop of **Easier Credit**, **Rising Expectations**, and **FOMO**. Microstructure reveals the mechanics: Lenders loosen standards (DTI, LTV), Appraisers hit "the number," and Flippers create artificial volume. The bust is triggered by a **Credit Event** (Rate hike) or **Affordability Ceiling**, leading to a Liquidity Freeze and then a Crash.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Affordability Index)
$$ Index = \frac{Median Income}{Qualifying Income for Median Home} $$
If Index < 100, housing is unaffordable.
Historically mean reverting.
Bubble $\implies$ Prices detach from Incomes (Ratio > 7x).

### Definition 2.2 (The Speculative Demand)
Normal Demand: Utility (Place to live).
Speculative Demand: Investment (Place to profit).
When Investors > 30% of buyers.
Market becomes a Financial Asset, susceptible to Volatility.
"Shadow Inventory" (Vacant held for appreciation).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The foreclosure Feedback Loop
Price $\downarrow$.
Equity < 0 (Underwater).
Walk away (Strategic Default).
Foreclosure Sale (Distressed Price).
Neighbor's Comparable Sales $\downarrow$.
Neighbor's Equity < 0.
Repeat.
2008 Crisis mechanic.

### 3.2 Supply Inelasticity
In Bubble locations (SF, London), Supply is constrained (Zoning).
Demand shock $\implies$ Price shock (Volume constant).
In Sprawl locations (Phoenix, Florida), Supply is elastic.
Demand shock $\implies$ Build boom $\implies$ Overhang $\implies$ Crash.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Tracking the Flippers
Data: Homes sold twice in < 12 months.
If Flip Volume % is high $\implies$ Late Cycle.
Flippers provide "Fake Liquidity."
When price stops rising, they vanish. Buyer strike.

### 4.2 Shorting Housing
Difficult. (Cannot short a house directly).
Short Homebuilders (XHB).
Short mREITs.
Buy CDS on RMBS (Big Short).
Regional divergence (Short Florida, Long Midwest).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Teaser Rates):**
ARMs (Adjustable Rate Mortgages).
Start at 2% fixed for 2 years. Jump to 7% floating.
Borrowers qualify at 2%.
Payment Shock at year 3.
New Regulation (Dodd-Frank) requires qualifying at the *fully indexed rate*.

**Exercise 2 (The Lock-in Effect):**
2023. Owners have 3% mortgages.
Current rate 7%.
Nobody sells. Inventory collapses.
Prices stay high despite low affordability.
"Stagflation" in housing. Volume crashes, Price drifts.
