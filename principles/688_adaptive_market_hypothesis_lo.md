# Adaptive Market Hypothesis Lo

## I. Executive Summary

The **Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH)** (Andrew Lo, 2004) reconciles the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** (EMH) with **Behavioral Economics**. It views the market as an **Evolutionary Biology** system rather than a Physics system. Strategies act as "Species" that compete for "Food" (Alpha). When the environment (Regime) changes, old species die (Strategies fail) and new ones evolve. Efficiency is not a destination, but a state of flux.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Evolutionary Efficiency)
Efficiency is dynamic.
Profit opportunities exist (Inefficiency) $\implies$ Predators (Arbs) enter $\implies$ Food becomes scarce $\implies$ Opportunity vanishes (Efficiency restored).
Cycle repeats.
EMH works in "Stable" environments. Behavioral anomalies persist in "Shifting" environments until adapted to.

### Definition 2.2 (The Risk-Reward Relation)
EMH: Risk is stable. Reward is function of Risk.
AMH: Risk is dynamic. Reward is function of Competition + Ecology.
During a crash (Mass extinction), risk premium is high because "Predators" are dead (Capital dried up).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Heuristics as Adaptations
Biases (Loss Aversion) are not "mistakes." They are "adaptations" to a prehistoric environment.
They become "maladaptations" in a modern financial environment.
Over time, the market "selects" for better heuristics (or Algos).

### 3.2 Survival of the Richest
Strategies that lose money go extinct (Fund closure).
Strategies that make money reproduce (Capital inflows / Copycats).
The market population evolves towards efficiency, but exogenous shocks (Tech, Regs) constantly reset the fitness landscape.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Regime Switching
AMH implies no strategy works forever.
"Alpha Decay" is inevitable.
The goal is not to find the "Holy Grail," but to Adapt.
Pivoting from Value to Growth to Momentum as the environment shifts.

### 4.2 Innovation
New financial products (ETFs, HFT) are evolutionary mutations.
Most fail. Some succeed and change the ecosystem.
Crypto is a Cambrian Explosion of new species.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The 2007 Quant Quake):**
Crowded trade in L/S Equity.
Too many predators (Funds) eating the same food.
Liquidation cascade.
Mass extinction event for Multi-Strat funds.
AMH predicted this (Carrying Capacity exceeded).

**Exercise 2 (Biological Time):**
Evolution takes generations.
In markets, a "generation" is a trading cycle.
Evolution happens at the speed of light (HFT).
Markets adapt faster than biological systems.
