# Outcome Bias Results vs Process

## I. Executive Summary

**Outcome Bias** is the error of evaluating the quality of a decision based on its **Result** rather than the **Process** used to make it. In probabilitistic fields like trading, a good decision (High EV) can lead to a loss, and a bad decision (Negative EV) can lead to a win. Focusing on outcomes reinforces bad habits (Luck) and punishes good strategy (Variance).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Quadrant)
1. **Good Process / Good Outcome:** Deserved Success.
2. **Good Process / Bad Outcome:** "Bad Beat" (Variance).
3. **Bad Process / Good Outcome:** "Dumb Luck" (Reinforced).
4. **Bad Process / Bad Outcome:** Poetic Justice.
Outcome Bias mistakes (3) for (1) and (2) for (4).

### Definition 2.2 (Hindsight Lens)
Knowing the outcome makes it seem inevitable.
"I knew it would crash."
Therefore, holding the short was "Smart."
But at T=0, the crash probability was 5%.
The decision to go All-In Short was reckless, validated by a Black Swan.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Reinforcement Learning
Brain learns via Dopamine.
Reward (Profit) $\implies$ "Do that again."
Data (Loss) $\implies$ "Don't do that."
In noisy environments (Markets), the signal is corrupted.
We learn superstition (Bad Process, Good Outcome).

### 3.2 Poker Analogy
Annie Duke. "Resulting."
Judging a hand by the river card.
Pro players focus exclusively on "Expected Value at the time of decision."
They ignore the pot outcome (mostly).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Process Journaling
Grade the trade BEFORE the exit.
"Setup: A+. Execution: Perfect."
If Outcome = Loss, ignore it. The trade was a success.
"Setup: F. Chased price."
If Outcome = Win, penalize yourself. The trade was a failure.

### 4.2 Algorithmic Backtesting
Backtest is unbiased by single outcomes.
$N=1000$ trades.
Outcome bias disappears in large samples (Law of Large Numbers).
Manual trading ($N=1$) is the trap.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Drunk Driver):**
Drunk driver gets home safely.
Is he a good driver?
Outcome Bias says Yes.
Rationality says No.
Leveraged Beta (going long 3x margin) in a Bull Market is the financial drunk driver.

**Exercise 2 (Manager Selection):**
Fund Manager up 50% this year.
Skill or Luck?
Look at Process (Sharpe, Drawdown, Consistency).
Don't chase the hot dot (Outcome).
