# Austerity vs Stimulus: The Policy War

## I. Executive Summary

**Austerity** is the policy of reducing government deficits through spending cuts or tax hikes during a downturn to "restore confidence." **Stimulus** (Keynesian) is the policy of increasing deficits to fill the demand gap. The historical evidence (Great Depression, 2011 Euro Crisis) overwhelmingly suggests that Austerity during a recession is self-defeating ("The Paradox of Thrift"), while Stimulus is necessary to prevent hysteresis.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Expansionary Austerity Hypothesis)
Idea: Cutting spending reduces fear of future taxes $\to$ Confidence rises $\to$ Private Inv rises.
Condition: Very rare. Only works if Exports are booming (Internal Devaluation).
Example: Ireland (Successful), Greece (Failed).

### Definition 2.2 (Fiscal Cliff)
Sudden removal of Stimulus.
If Deficit goes from 10% GDP to 5% GDP.
Fiscal Impulse is -5%.
This is a massive drag on growth.
Trading Risk: Buying stocks just as the Stimulus check runs out.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Composition of Adjustment
-   **Spending-Based Austerity:** Cutting politicians/wages. Usually better for growth (less distortion).
-   **Tax-Based Austerity:** Raising income tax. Kills incentives. Recessions last longer.

### 3.2 Political Economy
Austerity is politically expensive.
Stimulus is politically popular.
Democracies have a bias towards Deficits.
Debt Ceiling crises are political theater, not economic constraints.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Euro Area Bias
Germany (Ordoliberalism) enforces Austerity.
Southern Europe needs Stimulus.
Result: Structural low growth in Europe.
Long US Tech vs Short EU Banks.

### 4.2 FX Implications
Stimulus (US) + Austerity (EU).
US Growth > EU Growth.
US Rates > EU Rates.
USD strong.
Austerity currencies tend to be weak (Paradoxically) because the economy stagnates.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (UK 2010):**
Cameron/Osborne enacted Austerity.
UK Recovery was the slowest in G7 history.
Cost of borrowing was already low. No reason to cut.
"Self-inflicted wound."

**Exercise 2 (Truss 2022):**
Unfunded Stimulus (Tax cuts) during Inflation.
Market revolted.
"Bond Vigilantes" crashed the Gilt market.
Stimulus is good in Deflation. Bad in Inflation. Context implies execution.
