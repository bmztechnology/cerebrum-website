# Emerging Market Carry Trade: Risk vs Reward

## I. Executive Summary

The **EM Carry Trade** involves borrowing in a low-yielding currency (USD, JPY) and investing in a high-yielding EM currency (BRL, ZAR, TRY, MXN). It generates consistent "positive carry" (yield) in quiet times but suffers massive "crash risk" (negative skewness) during crises. It is effectively selling volatility: picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Carry Return)
$$R = (i_{em} - i_{usd}) - \Delta S$$
-   Interest Differential ($10\% - 5\% = 5\%$).
-   $\Delta S$: Deprecation of EM currency.
If BRL drops 2%, Net Return = 3%.
If BRL drops 10% (Crisis), Net Return = -5%.

### Definition 2.2 (The Momentum of Carry)
High Rates attract Capital $\to$ Currency Appreciates ($S \uparrow$).
Appreciation increases Total Return.
More Capital enters.
Virtuous Cycle (Bubble).
Until the Sudden Stop.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Volatility Targeting
Carry Trades are sized based on Volatility.
Position Size $\propto \frac{Yield}{\sigma}$.
If $\sigma$ (Vol) spikes, Algos deleverage (Sell).
Selling crashes the currency $\to$ $\sigma$ spikes more $\to$ More selling.
"Vol-Feedback Loop."

### 3.2 Commodity Link
Many High Yield currencies are Commodity Exporters (BRL=Iron/Soy, ZAR=Gold/Plat, MXN=Oil/Auto).
Carry is often a disguised Long Commodity trade.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Mexican Peso (Super Peso)
Mexico Rates 11.25%. US Rates 5%.
Spread 600bps.
Record Remittances. Near-shoring boom.
Result: MXN appreciated 20% in 2023.
Total Carry Return = Yield (11%) + FX Gain (20%) = 31%.
Best performing trade of 2023.

### 4.2 The Turkish Lira (The Trap)
Rates 40%.
Inflation 60%.
Real Rate -20%.
Carry is fake. Nominal yield is high, but currency depreciates faster than yield.
Rule: **Real Rates Must Be Positive.**

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Unwind 2008):**
JPY/BRL.
BRL yielded 14%. JPY 0%.
Great during boom.
2008 Crisis: BRL down 40%. JPY up 20% (Safe Haven).
Carry Traders wiped out.
Correlation goes to 1 in a crash.

**Exercise 2 (Funding Currency):**
Never fund with USD if Fed is hiking.
Fund with JPY or CHF (if their Central Banks are dovish).
Cross-Carry (e.g., Short EUR / Long MXN) isolates the trade from US Dollar risk.
