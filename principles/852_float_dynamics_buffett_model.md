# Float Dynamics The Buffett Model

## I. Executive Summary

**Float** is the money held by an insurer between the receipt of Premiums and the payment of Claims. It is effectively a **Negative Interest Rate Loan** (if Underwriting is profitable). Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway utilized Float to leverage equity returns without debt drag. The microstructure involves **Asset-Liability Management (ALM)**: matching the duration of the Float to the duration of the Investment Portfolio.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cost of Float)
$$ Cost = (Underwriting Loss) / Float $$
If Combined Ratio = 95% (5% Profit).
Cost of Float = -5%. (You are paid to hold the money).
If Combined Ratio = 105% (Loss).
Cost of Float = 5%. (Like a 5% Bond).
Berkshire's historic cost < 0%.

### Definition 2.2 (Long Tail vs Short Tail)
**Short Tail:** Property (Auto/Home). Claims paid quickly (Weeks). Float is transient.
**Long Tail:** Asbestos/Liability/Workers Comp. Claims paid over 30 years. Float is sticky.
Long Tail Float allows investing in Equities.
Short Tail Float requires T-Bills.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Leverage without Covenants
Float is leverage.
Assets = Equity + Float.
Unlike Bank Debt, Float cannot be "Called" (Run on the bank) as long as premiums keep coming.
"Permanent Capital" structure.
Behavioral edge: Allows holding stocks through 50% drawdowns (No margin call).

### 3.2 The St. Petersburg Paradox in Growth
Growing fast $\implies$ Float increases rapidly.
Shrinking $\implies$ Float flows out (Cash drain).
Insurers *must* grow or maintain volume to keep the Float.
"Ponzi-like" dynamic? No, provided reserves are adequate.
But stopping underwriting is fatal.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Total Return Reinsurance
Hedge Fund (Greenlight) starts Reinsurer (Greenlight Re).
Access to Float.
Invests Float in Hedge Fund strategies (Long/Short).
Volatile Assets + Volatile Liabilities (Cat risk).
High Beta measurement.
Often trades at discount to Book Value (unlike Berkshire).

### 4.2 LPT (Loss Portfolio Transfer)
AIG has messy old liabilities.
Berkshire (NICO) assumes liabilities for \$10B premium.
Berkshire bets it can pay out < \$10B over time OR make > return on the \$10B float.
"Run-off" expertise.
Cleaning up balance sheets.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Inflation Risk):**
Float is nominal liability.
If Inflation spikes, Claims cost rises.
If Investment portfolio (Bonds) falls.
Double hit.
Liability Driven Investing (LDI) failure.
Equities (Real Assets) hedge Long Tail inflation?

**Exercise 2 (Geico vs Gen Re):**
Geico: Marketing machine. Direct to consumer. High margin.
Gen Re: Large wholesale deals. Volatile.
Diverse sources of float stability.
