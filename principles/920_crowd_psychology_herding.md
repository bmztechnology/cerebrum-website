# Crowd Psychology Herding

## I. Executive Summary

**Crowd Psychology** (Le Bon) suggests that individual intelligence disappears in a group. In markets, this manifests as **Herding**, **Information Cascades**, and **Panics**. The mechanism is usually **Rational Herding** (it assumes others know something) or **reputational Herding** (better to fail with the crowd than fail alone).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Information Cascade)
Person A buys.
Person B sees A buy. Assumes A has info. Buys.
Person C sees A and B buy. Disregards own info (Sell) and Buys.
The "Cascade" is fragile. A small piece of public info can shatter it.
Explains rapid formation and collapse of bubbles.

### Definition 2.2 (Evaluation Anxiety)
Keynes: "Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally."
Fund Managers herd because deviating carries "Career Risk."
Index Hugging.
The Crowd reinforces the norm.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Soros' Boom-Bust Model
1. Trend begins (Fundamental).
2. Trend validated (Price Rise).
3. Narrative forms ("New Era").
4. Enthusiasm (Herding).
5. Divergence (Reality gap).
6. Climax (Buying exhaustion).
7. Crash.
The Crowd is essential for stages 3 and 4.

### 3.2 The Wisdom vs Madness of Crowds
Wisdom: Diversity, Independence, Decentralization (Prediction Markets).
Madness: Correlation, Dependence, Centralization (Bubbles).
When traders stop looking at data and start looking at *each other*, Wisdom becomes Madness.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Contrarian Investing
"Be fearful when others are greedy."
Hard to execute.
Requires standing against the "Social Proof."
Metrics: Put/Call Ratio, Cash Levels, Sentiment Surveys.
Buying when the Crowd is liquidating (providing liquidity to the panic).

### 4.2 Measuring Herding (LSV Measure)
Lakonishok, Shleifer, Vishny.
Measure extent to which funds buy/sell the same stock at the same time.
High Herding in Small Caps / Momentum Stocks.
Low Herding in Large Caps.
High Herding precedes reversals.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Empty Restaurant):**
Two restaurants. A is empty. B is empty.
First customer picks A randomly.
Next customer sees A has 1 person, B has 0. Picks A.
Line forms at A. B stays empty.
Path dependence. Market leaders often win by chance + cascade.

**Exercise 2 (Meme Stocks):**
GameStop.
Social Media (Reddit) synchronized the Crowd.
"Apes together strong."
The Crowd *became* the Whale.
Forced the Shorts (Hedge Funds) to cover.
Crowd as a strategic weapon.
