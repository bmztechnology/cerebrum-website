# Testosterone and Financial Risk Taking

## I. Executive Summary

**Testosterone (T)** is the hormone of dominance, competition, and risk-taking. In finance, elevated T (common in young males) is linked to **Overconfidence**, **Overtrading**, and **Bubbles**. The "Winner Effect" creates a positive feedback loop: Profits $\uparrow$ T $\uparrow$ Risk $\uparrow$ Profits... until the inevitable crash.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Winner Effect)
Winning a contest (or trade) spikes T.
Changes brain chemistry to crave more competition.
Adaptive in nature (fighting for mates).
Dangerous in markets (doubling down).
Coates found that traders with high morning T made more money that day, but extended high T led to blowups.

### Definition 2.2 (The 2D:4D Ratio)
Ratio of index finger to ring finger length.
Proxy for prenatal testosterone exposure.
Lower ratio (Longer ring finger) $\implies$ High Prenatal T.
Correlated with success in HFT/Day Trading ("Scrappy" risk taking).
Correlated with lower risk management.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Bubble Hormone
Experimental markets (Nadler).
Administering T to traders causes price bubbles.
They overestimate value and underestimate risk.
The Dot-Com bubble was fueled by a demographic bulge of young men (High T).

### 3.2 Demographics
Women have 10-20% the T of men.
Older men have declining T.
"Old Men" markets are stable/boring (Bonds).
"Young Men" markets are volatile/explosive (Crypto).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Diversity as Risk Management
A trading floor of 100% young males is a "Hormonal Monoculture."
Highly correlated failure mode (The "Alpha Male" crash).
Adding women / older traders dampens the T-feedback loop.
Biological Diversification.

### 4.2 The "Cooling Off" Protocol
Recognizing the "God Mode" feeling (High T).
"I can't lose."
This is the danger signal.
Mandatory break to let T levels normalize.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Winning Streak):**
After 3 wins in a row.
Probability of 4th win is 50%.
Subjective probability is 90%.
Why? Testosterone high.
Action: Halve position size on the 4th trade.

**Exercise 2 (Aggressive Acts):**
Slamming the mouse. Yelling.
Signs of T-spike.
Correlation with poor decision quality.
