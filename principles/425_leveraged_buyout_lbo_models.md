# Leveraged Buyout LBO Models: Debt Capacity

## I. Executive Summary

An **LBO Model** determines the price a Private Equity firm can pay for a target while achieving a target IRR (e.g., 20%). The core mechanic is **Financial Engineering**: using Cash Flow to pay down debt over 5 years. The exit value depends on the Exit Multiple. LBO analysis is the primary method for valuing High Yield and Mezzanine debt opportunities.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Equation)
$$ Returns \approx \text{Deleverage} + \text{Multiple Expansion} + \text{Earnings Growth} $$
-   **Deleverage:** Paying down debt increases Equity Value 1:1.
-   **IRR:** Internal Rate of Return on the *Equity Check*.

### Definition 2.2 (Sources and Uses)
-   **Uses:** Purchase Price + Refinance Old Debt + Fees.
-   **Sources:** New Senior Debt (3.0x EBITDA) + New Sub Debt (2.0x EBITDA) + Sponsor Equity (30-40% of Total).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Maximum Debt Capacity
Cash Flow Available for Debt Service (CFADS).
$$ CFADS = EBITDA - Capex - \Delta WC - Taxes $$
Model tests if CFADS covers Interest + Mandatory Amortization.
If not, need less debt (Price drops).

### 3.2 Sensitivity Analysis
IRR sensitivity to Exit Multiple and Exit Year.
"Multiple Arbitrage" (Buy at 8x, Sell at 10x) is rare.
Most models assume Exit Multiple = Entry Multiple.
Value creation must come from EBITDA growth or Debt Paydown.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Credit Committee
Bank uses LBO model to approve the loan.
"Can they repay 50% of the debt in 5 years?"
Sensitivity: "If EBITDA drops 20%, do they breach covenants?"
Base Case vs Downside Case.

### 4.2 Dividend Recaps
Sponsor takes a dividend in Year 3 by borrowing *more* money.
"Re-leveraging."
Boosts IRR (Early cash return).
Increases risk for original bondholders.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tax Shield):**
Interest is tax deductible.
LBO creates value by transferring taxes to interest payments.
Government subsidy of leverage.
Limits on deductibility (30% of EBITDA) reduce LBO prices.

**Exercise 2 (The Sweep):**
Cash Sweep Covenant.
50% of Excess Cash Flow must be used to prepay debt.
Accelerates deleveraging.
Reduces LBO flexibility.
