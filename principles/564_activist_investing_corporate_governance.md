# Activist Investing: Corporate Governance

## I. Executive Summary

**Activist Investing** is a strategy where the fund buys a significant minority stake in a public company to influence its management and board. The goal is to unlock shareholder value through **Strategic Changes** (Spin-offs, Mergers), **Financial Changes** (Buybacks, Dividends), or **Operational Fixes** (Firing the CEO, Cost cutting). It transforms the shareholder from a passive owner to an active participant.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The 13D Filing)
SEC requirement.
Must disclose ownership if stake $> 5\%$.
Signals to the market that an Activist has arrived.
Stock price usually jumps ("Activist Pop").

### Definition 2.2 (Proxy Fight)
If Management refuses demands.
Activist solicits votes (Proxies) from other shareholders to vote out the Board of Directors at the AGM.
Expensive, hostile, public battle.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Agency Costs
Principal-Agent Problem.
CEO (Agent) works for themselves (Private jets, Empire building).
Shareholders (Principal) want ROI.
Activist aligns the two by force.

### 3.2 Introduction of Discipline
Targeting companies with:
-   Excess Cash (Lazy balance sheet).
-   Unrelated Conglomerate divisions (Value trap).
-   Poor margins vs Peers.
"Governance Arbitrage."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Wolf Pack
Multiple hedge funds buy in, staying under 5% individually to avoid disclosure, then coordinate (implicitly) to swarm the management.
Legal grey area.

### 4.2 Constructive Activism
Working *with* the board behind closed doors.
"Suggesting" changes.
Less expensive, preserves reputation.
Often preferred by large institutional activists (BlackRock stewardship vs Icahn hostility).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Return on Invested Capital - ROIC):**
Activist mantra: "Capital Allocation."
Is money being wasted on low ROIC projects?
Demand return of capital to shareholders.

**Exercise 2 (Short Activism):**
Activist Short Seller.
Publicly attacking a company for fraud.
See: Ackman vs Herbalife.
Goal is to drive price down, not fix the company.
