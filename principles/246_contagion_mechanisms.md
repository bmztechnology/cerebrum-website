# Contagion Mechanisms: The Domino Effect

## I. Executive Summary

**Contagion** is the spread of market disturbances from one country to another, observing correlations that go to 1.0 during crises. It transmits via Trade Links, Financial Links (Common Lenders), and **Wake-Up Calls** (Sentiment). Famous examples: The Tequila Crisis (1994), Asian Contagion (1997), and Russian Virus (1998).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Common Lender Channel)
Bank A (Europe) lends to Brazil and Russia.
Russia defaults. Bank A loses capital.
Bank A must reduce Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) to meet Basel rules.
Bank A calls loans from Brazil (despite Brazil being healthy).
Brazil crashes.
Contagion through the Balance Sheet of the Center.

### Definition 2.2 (Competitive Devaluation Channel)
Thailand devalues Baht.
Thai exports become cheaper than Malaysian exports.
Malaysia loses competitiveness.
Malaysia is *forced* to devalue Ringgit.
Dominoes fall.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Wake-Up Call Hypothesis
Investors treat EMs as a homogeneous block ("Asset Class").
Crisis in Thailand reveals hidden risks (e.g., crony capitalism).
Investors wake up and ask: "Who else has crony capitalism?"
Indonesia, Korea.
They sell everything that looks like Thailand.
Logic: "Sell first, ask questions later."

### 3.2 Flight to Quality
EM Risk OFF $\to$ US Treasury ON.
Liquidity drains from Periphery to Core.
Accelerates the EM crash.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Proxy Hedging
You are Long Illiquid Nigerian Stocks.
Crisis hits. You can't sell (No liquidity).
Hedge: Short Liquid South African Rand (ZAR).
Proxy hedge works because correlations spike.
ZAR is the "ATM of Africa" (Liquid proxy used to hedge continent risk).

### 4.2 The Decoupling Myth
"This time, Brazil is different."
It rarely is.
When VIX > 40, everything correlates.
Risk management must assume Correlation = 1.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (LTCM 1998):**
Russia defaulted.
LTCM was long Russia / Short US Treasuries (Spread convergence).
Russia stopped paying. US Treasuries rallied (Flight to quality).
Spread widened to infinity.
LTCM blew up.

**Exercise 2 (Turkey 2018):**
Lira crashed.
Did it spread to Brazil/India?
No. Contagion was limited.
Why? Investors distinguished "Idiosyncratic Policy Error" (Erdogan) from systemic flaw.
Differentiation is possible in mature markets.
