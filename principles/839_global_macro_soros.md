# Global Macro Soros and Druckenmiller

## I. Executive Summary

**Global Macro** creates Alpha by predicting **Macroeconomic Trends** (Interest Rates, FX, GDP, Politics) and expressing them across asset classes. It is the most flexible strategy (Long/Short anything). Microstructure involves **Thematic Investing**, **Reflexivity**, and **Asymmetric Bets** (Convexity). It thrives in **Volatile/Trending** regimes and struggles in **Great Moderation** (Range-bound) regimes.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Reflexivity)
George Soros.
Market bias influences fundamentals. Fundamentals influence market.
Feedback loop.
Price rising $\to$ Banks lend more $\to$ Earnings rise $\to$ Price rises.
Bubble formation.
Macro trader bets on the *disequilibrium*.

### Definition 2.2 (The Asymmetric Trade)
Stan Druckenmiller.
"I don't care about being right. I care about how much I make when I'm right vs how much I lose when I'm wrong."
Shorting the British Pound (1992).
Downside: small interest carry. Upside: Devaluation (20%).
Risk/Reward 1:20.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Policy Trilemma
Impossible Trinity.
Country cannot have Fixed Exchange Rate, Free Capital Flow, and Independent Monetary Policy.
If they try $\implies$ Crisis.
Macro traders hunt for Trilemma violations (Peg breaks).

### 3.2 Carry vs Volatility
**Carry:** Long high yield, Short low yield. (Steady income, Short Volatility).
**Macro:** Long Volatility (Options, Trend Following).
Macro is often "Anti-Carry." Cost of bleeding chips waiting for the big move.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Curve Trade
Betting on Steepening or Flattening of Yield Curve.
"Flattener": Short Short-End / Long Long-End? No, usually Short Long / Long Short?
Betting on Recession (Bull Steepener) vs Inflation (Bear Steepener).
Executions via Eurodollar Futures or Treasury Spreads.

### 4.2 Commodity Super-Cycles
China demand (2000s).
Supply constraint (2020s).
Long Commodities, Short Commodity Importers (JPY).
Thematic correlation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (USD Wrecking Ball):**
Rising USD tightens global liquidity (Eurodollar shortage).
Short Emerging Markets.
Macro logic: Strong Dollar $\to$ E.M. Default.

**Exercise 2 (The Widowmaker):**
Shorting JGBs (Japanese Gov Bonds).
Betting yields must rise.
BOJ Yield Curve Control (YCC) crushed traders for 20 years.
"Don't fight the central bank."
Until YCC broke in 2023.
