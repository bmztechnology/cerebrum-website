# Inflation Hedging Real Assets: Purchasing Power

## I. Executive Summary

**Inflation Hedging** protects the portfolio's real purchasing power. Standard assets (Bonds, Cash) suffer in high inflation. **Real Assets** (Real Estate, Commodities) and Inflation-linked Bonds (**TIPS**) theoretically maintain value. However, the **Correlation** changes depending on whether inflation is "Demand Pull" (Growth, good for Stocks) or "Cost Push" (Stagflation, bad for Stocks).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Inflation Beta)
Sensitivity of asset return to CPI surprises.
-   **TIPS:** Beta $\approx$ 1. (Contractual).
-   **Gold:** Beta > 1? (Historical store of value).
-   **Stocks:** Beta < 0? (Inflation hurts P/E multiples).
-   **Real Estate:** Beta > 0 (Rents rise with inflation).

### Definition 2.2 (Real Rate Sensitivity)
Gold Price $\approx f(1/RealRate)$.
If Inflation rises but Fed hikes rates *faster* (Real Rates rise), Gold crashes.
Gold is a hedge against *Negative Real Rates*, not just high CPI.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Financialization of Commodities
Since 2005 (GSCI ETFs).
Commodities correlate more with Equities (Risk On/Off).
Diversification benefit reduced?
In 2022, Commodities were the only asset up. Diversification returned when needed.

### 3.2 The TIPS Illusion
TIPS principal links to CPI.
But TIPS *Price* links to Duration (Real Yields).
If Real Yields spike (Fed tightening), TIPS Price crashes.
2022: TIPS ETFs down 15%.
Inflation hedge failed? No, Duration risk materialized.
Hold-to-maturity TIPS protected purchasing power. Mark-to-market TIPS did not.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Liquid Real Assets
REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Infrastructure Stocks (Toll roads, Utilities).
Natural Resource Equities (Miners).
Easier to trade than physical buildings/farmland.
But higher correlation to broad stock market.

### 4.2 Crypto as Hedge?
"Digital Gold."
Theoretically sound (Fixed supply).
Historically: Correlated with Tech Stocks (High Beta).
Failed as inflation hedge in 2022.
So far, acts as a Liquidity sponge, not a Numeraire.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Breakeven Trading):**
Buy TIPS / Short Nominal Treasury.
Pure inflation bet.
Removes the Duration Risk (if durations matched).
"Breakeven Inflation" trade.

**Exercise 2 (Inventory Hedges):**
Companies hedge input costs.
Airlines hedge Fuel.
Starbucks hedges Coffee.
If Inflation spikes, hedged companies outperform unhedged ones.
Operational hedging.
