# Time in Trade: The Fourth Dimension of Risk

## I. Executive Summary

Time is an exposure risk vector distinct from Price. The longer a position remains open, the higher the probability of an exogenous shock (News, Geopolitics) occurring that invalidates the technical thesis. Furthermore, capital tied up in a stagnating trade incurs **Opportunity Cost**. "Time in Trade" analysis seeks to optimize the duration of exposure, ensuring that capital is only deployed when momentum is present.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stagnation Cost)
If a trade has not reached Target $T$ or Stop $S$ within time $t_{limit}$, the thesis is likely flawed.
$$P(Win | Duration > t_{limit}) \ll P(Win | Duration < t_{limit})$$
*Rule:* "If it doesn't go right, get out." (Paul Tudor Jones).

### Definition 2.2 (Market Memory)
The duration for which a technical pattern remains valid.
-   **M5 Pattern validity:** $\approx 30$ minutes.
-   **H4 Pattern validity:** $\approx 24$ hours.
Holding an M5 scalp for 4 hours transforms a Technical trade into a Gambling trade.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Time-Stop vs Price-Stop
A **Time-Stop** exits the trade at a specific time (e.g., Close of Session) regardless of PnL.
-   *Benefit:* Eliminates overnight gap risk.
-   *Benefit:* Enforces turnover.

### 3.2 The Theta Decay of Momentum
Options have Theta (Time Decay). Spot FX momentum also decays.
-   Impulse moves are fast.
-   Corrections are slow.
If a trade enters an impulse phase but slows down, it is entering correction. The "Theta" of the setup has expired.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Bar Count Rule
"If the trade is not in profit after 3 bars, exit."
-   *Logic:* Momentum entries should work immediately. Failure to launch is failure of signal.

### 4.2 End of Day (EOD) Protocol
Prop Shops often require Flat portfolios at 17:00 EST.
-   *Reason:* Risk Management cannot control the Asian Open gap.
-   *Strategy:* Convert Swing trades to Break-Even before EOD or measure volatility of the Asian session before holding.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Efficiency):**
Trade A: Makes 50 pips in 1 Hour.
Trade B: Makes 50 pips in 1 Week.
Calculate the "Velocity of Return" (Pips/Hour) for both.
Why is Trade A superior for Compounding?

**Exercise 2 (Analysis):**
Review your last 10 losers.
How many were "Zombie Trades" that hovered around entry for hours before finally hitting the stop?
How much capital would you have saved with a "Time Stop" at 2 hours?

**Exercise 3 (Swap Impact):**
Trade C is Short USD/TRY. (Negative Swap).
It moves sideways for 1 month.
Price is unchanged.
Are you Breakeven, Profitable, or Losing? (Losing massively due to cost of carry + inflation).
