# CLO Leveraged Loans: The Corporate Engine

## I. Executive Summary

**Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)** are CDOs backed by **Leveraged Loans** (Senior Secured floating-rate bank loans to corporates), not mortgages. CLOs are the largest buyers of corporate debt. Unlike Subprime CDOs, CLOs proved incredibly resilient in 2008 and 2020 due to active management, covenant protections, and the seniority of loans in the capital structure.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Asset: Leveraged Loan)
-   **Senior Secured:** First lien on assets. High recovery (70%).
-   **Floating Rate:** Coupons = SOFR + Share. Low duration risk.
-   **Cov-Lite:** Modern loans lack maintenance covenants (Risk).

### Definition 2.2 (OC and IC Tests)
-   **Over-Collateralization (OC) Test:** Value of Assets / Value of Liabs > 105%. If failed, cashflows to Equity are diverted to pay down AAA. (Self-healing).
-   **Interest Coverage (IC) Test:** Income / Interest > 110%.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Arbitrage Machine
CLO issuance depends on the "Arb."
Spread on Loans vs Cost of CLO Debt.
If Spreads widen, Equity returns explode (Locked low cost of debt, high asset yield).
If Spreads screw tight, CLO creation stops.

### 3.2 Manager Types (Tier 1 vs Tier 3)
Tier 1 Managers (Blackstone, Apollo) get cheaper liability pricing.
Tier 3 Managers must take more risk to generate same equity return.
Manager styling (High overlap vs idiosyncratic).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 CLO Equity
"The best performing asset class of the last decade."
Double digit yields (15-20%).
Why? Structural leverage (10x). Callability (Refinancing liabs).
Risk: Default wave wipes out the OC cushion.

### 4.2 AAA CLO as Cash Substitute
Institutions buy AAA CLOs (Yield: SOFR + 150) vs Treasuries (SOFR + 0).
Perceived risk: Minimal.
Liquidity risk: High (in crisis).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Libor Floors):**
When rates were 0%, Loans had "1% Floor."
CLO Liabs had 0% Floor.
Arbitrage gain of 1% extra spread.
As rates rose > 1%, this benefit vanished.

**Exercise 2 (Weighted Average Rating Factor - WARF):**
Limits the amount of CCC rated junk.
If CCC bucket exceeds 7.5%, excess is marked at Market Value (punitive) rather than Par.
Fail OC test.
Managers sell CCCs near quarter end to "wash" the portfolio.
