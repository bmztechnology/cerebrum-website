# Narrative Economics Shiller

## I. Executive Summary

**Narrative Economics** (Robert Shiller) argues that **Stories** drive economic events. A contagious narrative (e.g., "The Internet changes everything," "Housing never falls") spreads like a **Virus**, influencing behavior and checking prices. The **Viral Coefficient** ($R_0$) of a story matters more than its truth. Markets are effectively **Idea Markets**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Epidemiology of Narratives)
SIS Model (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible).
Story spreads via word of mouth/media.
Adoption Curve: S-Curve.
Early Adopters $\to$ Peak Hype $\to$ Immunity (Boredom).
Bubbles pop when the Narrative runs out of "Susceptible" hosts (Greater Fools).

### Definition 2.2 (Perennial Narratives)
Stories that recur.
"New Era" (Tech, Crypto, AI).
"Frugality/Doomsday" (Depression mindset).
"Boy Genius" (Sam Bankman-Fried, Elon Musk).
These templates are hardwired into culture.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Coordination Mechanism
How do millions coordinate a bubble?
The Narrative provides the Schelling Point.
"Buy Bitcoin."
Simple, actionable, emotionally resonant.
Data is complex. Stories are simple.
Stories win.

### 3.2 Feedback Loops
Price Rise verifies Narrative.
"See? It's going up. The story is true."
Stronger Narrative attracts more buying.
Price Rise.
Until Price becomes absurd.
Then Narrative shifts: "It's a scam."
Price Crash.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Narrative Alpha
Natural Language Processing (NLP) on News/Social.
Tracking keywords.
"AI" mentions in earnings calls (2023).
Alpha strategy: Buy *early* in the viral curve. Sell at Peak Hype.
"Surfing the Narrative."

### 4.2 Counter-Narrative Hedge
If everyone believes "Inflation is dead" (2021).
The risk is asymmetric.
Betting against the consensus narrative.
"The Big Short."
Requires high conviction to withstand social pressure.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Tulip Mania):**
Narrative: "Tulips are the badge of nobility."
Fundamental value: Zero (it's a flower).
Price decoupled.
Crash narrative: "The government will ban trading."

**Exercise 2 (Modern Monetary Theory - MMT):**
Narrative: "Deficits don't matter."
Allowed massive spending.
Result: Inflation?
Economic policy driven by the dominant academic narrative.
