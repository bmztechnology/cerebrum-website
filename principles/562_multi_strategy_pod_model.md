# Multi Strategy Pod Model: The Platform

## I. Executive Summary

The **Multi-Strategy (Multi-Strat)** or "Platform" model (e.g., Millennium, Citadel, Point72) aggregates dozens or hundreds of independent trading teams ("Pods") under one roof. Each Pod runs a specific strategy (L/S, RV, Macro) with strict **Risk Limits**. The Central Management allocates capital to Pods based on performance and handles back-office, compliance, and execution. The goal is high Sharpe Ratio via extreme diversification and ruthless cutting of underperformers.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Risk Limits / Drawdown Control)
Strict rules:
-   Down 3% in a month $\implies$ Capital halved.
-   Down 5% in a month $\implies$ Fired (Team liquidated).
"Stop loss on the Manager."
Prevents emotional holding of losers.

### Definition 2.2 (Netting)
Central Desk nets internal trades.
Pod A buys AAPL. Pod B shorts AAPL.
Firm exposure = 0.
Saves transaction costs and bid-ask spread.
Internal crossing engine.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Pass-Through Fees
Unlike "2 and 20".
Platforms pass all costs (Salaries, data, office, bonuses) to the investor.
investor pays "Expenses + Incentive Fee."
Can equal 5% to 10% fees.
Justified by high Net Returns (10-15% steady) and 0 correlation.

### 3.2 The Alpha Stream
Treating PMs (Portfolio Managers) as uncorrelated return streams.
Modern Portfolio Theory applied to *people*.
Platform is a "Fund of Funds" but with real-time transparency and control over the positions.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Dispersion and Neutrality
Most Pods are required to be Beta Neutral and Sector Neutral.
Alpha must be idiosyncratic.
Firm runs a central "Center Book" to hedge out residual risks or take optimal overlays.

### 4.2 Assessing Talent
The Competition for Alpha.
Hiring form competitors.
"Gardening leave."
The model relies on an infinite supply of trading talent.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The GMV Constraint):**
Gross Market Value limits leverage.
Pod has \$100M capital, 4x GMV limit.
Can hold \$200M Long / \$200M Short.
Limits tail risk from massive leverage.

**Exercise 2 (Crowding):**
If all Pods use similar data, they might correlate.
Factor Risk Models (Barra) used to detect hidden correlations across the specific pods.
