# GIPS Standards Compliance: Truth in Advertising

## I. Executive Summary

**GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards)** is a set of ethical principles for calculating and presenting investment performance. Created by the CFA Institute, it ensures fair representation and full disclosure. Key concepts include creating **Composites** (grouping similar portfolios), using **Time-Weighted Returns** (to eliminate cash flow timing bias), and strict policies on **Survivorship Bias** and **Cherry Picking**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (TWR vs MWR)
-   **TWR (Time Weighted Return):** Geometric linking of sub-period returns. Removes impact of external cash flows (which manager cannot control). Standard for GIPS.
-   **MWR (Money Weighted Return):** IRR. Penalizes manager if client adds cash at the top. Used for Private Equity (where manager controls the call).

### Definition 2.2 (The Composite)
"All fee-paying, discretionary portfolios must be included in at least one composite."
Cannot pick only the 5 best accounts to show the prospect.
Must include terminated accounts (up to the last full month).
Prevents Survivor Bias.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Input Data
Must use Trade Date accounting (not Settlement Date).
Accrual accounting for Fixed Income.
Fair Value hierarchy (Level 1, 2, 3) for illiquid assets.

### 3.2 Dispersion
Must present internal dispersion of the composite (High vs Low return accounts).
If Dispersion is high, the "Composite Return" is not representative of what any single client received.
Indicates loose implementation or customization.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Verification
Firms claim "GIPS Compliant."
Independent Verification (by Big 4 accounting firm) tests the claim.
"Verified for the period 2010-2020."
Marketing Gold Standard. Institutions won't hire un-verified firms.

### 4.2 Carve-Outs
Can you market your "Tech Sector" performance if it was just part of a larger "Growth Fund"?
GIPS requires Carve-Outs to have their own cash allocation ( be managed as standalone) to be marketed separately.
Prevents hindsight bias ("We would have held 5% cash in this carve-out").

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Linking):**
Geometric linking.
$(1+R_1) \times (1+R_2) ... - 1$.
Not arithmetic sum.

**Exercise 2 (Fees):**
Gross of Fees vs Net of Fees.
GIPS allows Gross, but recommends Net.
Must disclose Fee Schedule.
Retail clients usually see Net. Institutional see Gross.
