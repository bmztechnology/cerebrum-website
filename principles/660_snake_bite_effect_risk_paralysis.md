# Snake Bite Effect Risk Paralysis

## I. Executive Summary

The **Snake Bite Effect** is the opposite of the Break-Even Effect. After a significant or traumatic loss, investors become **Hyper-Risk Averse**, refusing to take even positive Expected Value ($+EV$) trades. They are "bitten" and shy away. This often causes them to miss the recovery (e.g., selling near the bottom of 2008 and staying in cash until 2013).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Desensitization vs Sensitization)
Break-Even = Desensitized to risk (Numb).
Snake Bite = Sensitized to risk (Trauma).
Usually depends on the *speed* of the loss.
Slow bleed $\implies$ Break Even (Death by 1000 cuts).
Sudden crash $\implies$ Snake Bite (Shock).

### Definition 2.2 (Path Dependence)
Current allocation depends on past PnL path.
Rational agent: Allocation = f(Wealth, Opportunity Set).
Bitten agent: Allocation = 0% Stocks (despite cheap valuations).
"Recency Bias" on steroids.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Learned Helplessness
Seligman.
Dogs shocked repeatedly gave up trying to escape.
Traders whipped by volatility stop looking for setups.
"Whatever I do, I lose."
Leads to depression and exit.

### 3.2 The Hot Stove Effect
Mark Twain: "A cat that sits on a hot stove will never sit on a hot stove again. But he won't sit on a cold one either."
Inability to distinguish between "Market Risk" (Normal) and "Crash Risk" (Specific).
Over-generalization of danger.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Re-Entry Strategy
After a blow-up.
Do not go "All In."
Trade 10% size.
Goal: Not to make money, but to rebuild confidence aka "Exposure Therapy."
Prove that the stove is not hot.

### 4.2 Buying the Fear
When the public is snake bitten (Fund outflows), future returns are highest.
"Capitulation" implies the selling is done.
The Snake Bite creates the Valuation Discount.
