# Global Custody and Clearing

## I. Executive Summary

**Custody** is the bedrock of asset safety. **Global Custodians** (BNY Mellon, State Street) hold assets for institutions, process trades ("Clearing and Settlement"), collect dividends ("Asset Servicing"), and handle tax reclamation. They do not manage risk; they manage **Record Keeping**. In a digital world, Custody is evolving into **Data Management** and **Collateral Optimization**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (DVP - Delivery Versus Payment)
Settlement mechanism.
Cash moves only if Securities move.
Eliminates **Herstatt Risk** (Principal risk).
T+1 Settlement: Reducing the time window of counterparty risk.

### Definition 2.2 (Segregation)
Client assets must be segregated from Bank assets.
If Custodian goes bankrupt, Client assets are safe.
(Unlike a deposit, which is a liability of the bank).
Lehman Re-hypothecation issue: When segregation fails.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Network Effect
Tri-Party Repo.
Custodians sit between Cash Lenders and Collateral Providers.
Manage the collateral movements.
Natural monopoly? Only a few global giants can afford the tech/compliance.

### 3.2 Tokenization
Blockchain as the ultimate custodian?
"Atomic Settlement" (T+0).
Removing the clearinghouse (DTCC).
Custodians pivoting to "Digital Asset Custody" (Holding Private Keys).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Securities Lending
Custodian lends client's idle stock to Short Sellers.
Fee split (e.g., 70% to Client, 30% to Custodian).
Pays for the custody service.
Risk: Borrower defaults + Collateral insufficient.

### 4.2 Proxy Voting
Custodian processes millions of proxy votes for index funds.
Infrastructure of corporate governance.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Omnibus Accounts):**
Assets held in name of "State Street Nominees."
Sub-accounting ledger tracks beneficial owners.
Efficiency vs Transparency.

**Exercise 2 (Fail to Deliver):**
Back office nightmare.
Buy-in procedures.
Fines (CSDR in Europe).
Operational alpha = Zero fails.
