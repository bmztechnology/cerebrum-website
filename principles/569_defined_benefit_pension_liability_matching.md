# Defined Benefit Pension Liability Matching

## I. Executive Summary

**Defined Benefit (DB)** plans promise employees a specific readout (e.g., 60% of final salary) for life. The employer bears the investment risk. The primary objective is not "Maximize Return" but **"Solvency"**: ensuring Assets $\ge$ Liabilities. This requires **Asset-Liability Management (ALM)**, hedging interest rate risk (Duration matching), and generating enough growth to cover the "Funding Gap."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Liability)
$L = \sum \frac{Benefit_t}{(1+r)^t}$.
Crucial variable is $r$ (Discount Rate).
If $r$ fell from 5% to 1% (2010-2020), Liabilities exploded.
A "Crisis of Duration", not of Asset Performance.

### Definition 2.2 (Funded Status)
$Ratio = Assets / Liabilities$.
$Ratio < 80\%$: Critical Zone.
Sponsor must contribute cash (impacts corporate earnings).
"Pension Deficit."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 LDI (Liability Driven Investment)
Match the duration.
Liabilities have duration of 15-20 years.
Assets must have duration of 15-20 years.
Buy Long STRIPS.
Use Interest Rate Swaps to extend duration of equity portfolio.

### 3.2 The Return Seeking Portfolio
If fully hedged, you only earn the Risk Free Rate.
But liabilities grow with wage inflation.
Need "Growth Bucket" (Equities, PE, Hedge Funds) to close the deficit.
Risk: Mismatch between Growth Assets and Liability characteristics.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 De-Risking Glidepath
If Funded Status = 70%: 60% Growth / 40% Hedging.
If Funded Status = 90%: 40% Growth / 60% Hedging.
If Funded Status = 100%: 10% Growth / 90% Hedging (Lock it in).
Automated rebalancing rules.

### 4.2 Pension Risk Transfer (PRT)
Sell the plan to an Insurance Company.
Employer pays a lump sum premium. Insurer takes over payments.
Removes liability from corporate balance sheet.
Good for shareholders, debated for employees (Loss of PBGC protection?).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Discount Rate Assumption):**
Public funds often assume 7.5% return (ROA) to discount liabilities.
Corporate funds must use AA Corp Bond yield (e.g., 4%).
Public funds look solvent, Corporates looked insolvent.
"The Accounting Illusion."

**Exercise 2 (Longevity Risk):**
People living longer.
Liabilities increase.
Need "Longevity Swaps" to hedge?
