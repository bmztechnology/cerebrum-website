# Ellsberg Paradox Ambiguity Aversion

## I. Executive Summary

The **Ellsberg Paradox** (Daniel Ellsberg, 1961) reveals that people are **Ambiguity Averse**. They prefer **Risk** (Known probabilities) to **Uncertainty/Ambiguity** (Unknown probabilities). This distinction (Knightian Uncertainty) explains the **Home Bias** (we know our own market's distribution) and the **Equity Premium Puzzle** (stocks are ambiguous, bonds are risky).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Urn Problem)
Urn contains 90 balls.
30 Red.
60 Black or Yellow (ratio unknown).
Bet A: Red (\$100). (Prob = 1/3).
Bet B: Black (\$100). (Prob = Unknown [0 to 2/3]).
Most pick A.
Bet C: Red or Yellow.
Bet D: Black or Yellow. (Prob = 2/3).
Most pick D.
Inconsistent probability assignments. Driven by "Fear of the Unknown."

### Definition 2.2 (Source Dependence)
We prefer betting on sources where we feel "Competent."
Betting on NFL vs Betting on Cricket (for Americans).
Even if odds are identical.
Ambiguity is subjective.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Worst-Case Thinking (Maxmin)
In ambiguous situations, we assume the worst distribution.
"If I bet Black, the urn is probably all Yellow."
Paranoia.
Evolutionarily adaptive (Assume the rustling grass is a lion, not wind).

### 3.2 Information Asymmetry Fear
"If the odds are unknown to me, maybe they are known to *someone else* (The House)?"
We fear being the "Sucker."
In known probability (Roulette), there is no information asymmetry. We endure the risk.
In unknown (IPO), we fear the insider.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Ambiguity Premium
Assets with opaque balance sheets (Banks/Hudge Funds) trade at a discount.
"Complexity Discount."
Clarifying the business model (Reducing ambiguity) raises the stock price.

### 4.2 Crisis Investing
During a crash, correlations break (Ambiguity spikes).
"I don't know what my correlations are anymore."
Flight to Safety (Treasuries) is a Flight from Ambiguity.
Gold is an ambiguity hedge (No counterparty).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Missing Data):**
Stock A: 10 years of history.
Stock B: 1 month of history.
Volatility identical.
Investors demand higher return for Stock B.
Tenure premium.

**Exercise 2 (Political Risk):**
Emerging Markets.
"Rule of Law" ambiguity.
"Will the government nationalize?"
Unquantifiable risk $\implies$ Capital strike.
