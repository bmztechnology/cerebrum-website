# Oil Market Microstructure Brent vs WTI

## I. Executive Summary

**Crude Oil** is the world's most traded commodity. The market is split into benchmarks: **WTI** (US - Landlocked, Cushing delivery) and **Brent** (Global - Seaborne, North Sea). Microstructure involves the **Physical Window** (Platts MOC), **Futures** (NYMEX/ICE), and **Swaps**. The "Fixing" process by Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs) determines the price of billions of dollars of physical cargo based on a tiny window of activity.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Benchmarks)
**WTI (West Texas Intermediate):** Pipeline delivery at Cushing, OK. Light Sweet. Sensitive to US logistics.
**Brent:** Basket of North Sea streams (BFOET). Seaborne. Global reference (60% of world oil).
**Spread:** Brent - WTI. Historically positive (Brent > WTI) due to US export ban (lifted 2015). Now driven by logistics (freight).

### Definition 2.2 (The Platts MOC - Market on Close)
The "Window." 30 minutes of intense bidding/offering.
Platts reporter observes trades.
Determines "The Assesssment."
Physical contracts are priced as "Platts Brent + Premium."
HFTs cannot participate (Voice/Chat driven).
Majors (Shell, BP) dominate.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Financialization
Volume of Paper Oil (Futures) = 30x Physical Production.
Does the Tail wag the Dog?
Financial flows (CTA Trend Following) drive Spot Prices?
Or do Spot Prices (Physical balancing) anchor Futures?
Consensus: Short term financial, Long term physical.

### 3.2 The Refining Crack Spread
Margin = Product Price (Gasoline + Diesel) - Crude Price.
"3-2-1 Crack": 3 Crude $\to$ 2 Gas + 1 Distillate.
Refiners hedge this spread.
If Crack narrows $\implies$ Refiners cut runs $\implies$ Crude demand falls $\implies$ Crude Price falls.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 BFOET Squeeze
Brent basket is small (Production declining).
A trader buys up all the physical cargoes of "Forties" (one stream).
Squeezes the whole Brent Complex.
Exchanges added "Troll" and "Ekofisk" to broaden the basket and stop squeezes.

### 4.2 OPEC+ Signaling
OPEC announces cut.
Algos read headline. Buy Futures.
Physical market tightens 1 month later (Shipping delay).
The lag between Algo reaction (ms) and Physical reaction (weeks) creates Basis volatility.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Cushing Fill):**
Satellite imagery (Orbital Insight) measures shadow on tank roofs.
Estimates inventory in real-time.
Trades data before EIA report.
Information asymmetry.

**Exercise 2 (Negative Prices):**
WTI May 2020.
Contract requires physical delivery.
Retail ETF (USO) and Speculators held Longs.
Could not take delivery.
Desperate selling to HFTs/Physical Merchants.
Price went to $-\$40$.
Lesson: Understand the settlement spec.
