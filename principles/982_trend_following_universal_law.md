# Trend Following The Universal Law

## I. Executive Summary

**Trend Following** (Managed Futures / CTAs) is the strategy of buying what is going up and selling what is going down. It is **Agnostic** to fundamentals. It exploits **Behavioral Biases** (Herding, Anchoring) and **Institutional Mandates** (Slow moving capital). It is the only strategy that has performed well in **Every Crisis** for 100 years.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Moving Average Crossover)
Price > 200 Day MA $\implies$ Long.
Price < 200 Day MA $\implies$ Short.
Simple. Robust.
Why does it work?
Because information diffuses slowly.
Because Central Banks create long cycles.
"The Trend is your Friend."

### Definition 2.2 (Cut Losers / Let Winners Run)
Convex payoff profile.
Win rate: 40% (Low).
Avg Win / Avg Loss: 3:1 (High).
You lose often (Whipsaws in choppy markets).
You win big (Ride the trend for months).
Psychologically hard (Feeling like a loser 60% of the time).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Divergent vs Convergent Strategies
Convergent: Mean Reversion. "Price is wrong, will come back." (Arbitrage). Value Investing. Short Vol.
Divergent: Trend Following. "Price is changing, will go further." (Momentum).
Divergent strategies love Chaos/Black Swans.
They are naturally Long Volatility.
Convergent strategies blow up in Black Swans.

### 3.2 Timeframes
Short-term Trend (Days): High noise, HFT dominated.
Medium-term Trend (Weeks): Swing trading.
Long-term Trend (Months/Years): Macro trends.
Best performance historically: Long-term Trend (12 month lookback).

## IV. Strategic Applications

2008: Stocks -50%. CTAs +15% (Short Finance, Short Energy).
2022: Stocks -20%, Bonds -15%. CTAs +30% (Short Bonds, Long Energy).
Trend Following is the perfect compliment to a Stock/Bond portfolio.
It makes money on the "Short Side" during bear markets.

### 4.2 Multi-Asset Scope

Stocks, Bonds, Currencies, Corn, Lean Hogs, Carbon, Crypto.
Diversification across 50+ markets.
If Stocks chop, maybe Cocoa trends.
"Everything is a market."
