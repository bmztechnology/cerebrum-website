# The Democratization of Alts

## I. Executive Summary

Historically, Alternatives were reserved for **QIBs** (Qualified Institutional Buyers) and **Accredited Investors**. Technology and Regulation (Reg A+, JOBS Act) are opening these changes to **Retail Investors**. Platforms (Masterworks, Moonfare, Yieldstreet) fractionize private assets. This **Democratization** brings liquidity but introduces **Suitability Risk** and **Adverse Selection**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Fractionalization)
Asset: \$10M Painting.
SPV buys painting.
Smart Contract/Platform issues 100,000 shares at \$100.
Retail buys shares.
Benefits: Access + Diversification.
Costs: Platform fees (sourced + management + carry) often > 5%.

### Definition 2.2 (Adverse Selection in Retail Alts)
Institutional Quality vs Retail Scraps.
If a deal is good, Blackstone keeps it for its Institutional Fund.
If it's "Okay," it goes to the Retail Fund?
"Stuffing" the retail channel.
Retail must ask: "Why am I seeing this deal?"

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Liquidity Mismatch (Again)
Retail expects "Click to Sell" (Robinhood experience).
Private Equity is 10-year lockup.
Platforms offer "Secondary Bulletin Boards."
Liquidity is thin.
Educating retail on the "J-Curve" (Losses in early years) is a massive compliance hurdle.

### 3.2 Regulatory Catch-up
SEC "Accredited Investor" definition.
Wealth-based (Rich = Smart?).
Moving to Sophistication-based (Exam pass = Smart).
Allows knowledgeable but poor professionals to invest.
Expands the TAM (Total Addressable Market) for Alts.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA)
BlackRock tokenizing Money Market Fund.
Real Estate on blockchain.
Promise: 24/7 Global Trading + Atomic Settlement.
Reality: Legal wrapper is still slow. If tenant stops paying rent, blockchain doesn't evict them.
Hybrid analog-digital structures.

### 4.2 High Net Worth (HNW) Channels
Banks (UBS/Morgan Stanley) pushing Alts to Private Wealth clients.
"The 60/40 portfolio is dead. You need 50/30/20."
Allocating 20% to Alts.
Fees: Structuring fee + Feeder fund fee + Underlying fund fee.
Fee layering erodes returns.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Masterworks Analysis):**
Track record.
"15% annual returns."
Selection bias? (Only showing sold paintings?).
Fee structure: 1.5% Mgmt + 20% Carry.
High hurdle for Retail to beat S&P 500 net of fees.
But provides "Passion" utility.

**Exercise 2 (Crowdfunding Real Estate):**
Fundrise.
Direct sourcing of deals.
Lower fees than Blackstone?
Performance correlation with housing market.
Liquidity mechanism (Quarterly tenders).
