# Low Volatility Anomaly Betting Against Beta: Defense

## I. Executive Summary

The **Low Volatility Anomaly** observes that stocks with low historical volatility (or low Beta) have delivered higher Sharpe Ratios than high volatility stocks, and often higher absolute returns. This defies CAPM (where High Beta should earn High Return). The **Betting Against Beta (BAB)** factor (Frazzini & Pedersen) exploits this by leveraging low-beta assets and shorting high-beta assets.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Leverage Aversion)
Why does it exist?
Institutional Investors (Mutual Funds) have **Leverage Constraints**.
They cannot borrow magnitude.
To beat the market (get high return), they *must* overweight High Beta stocks.
This excess demand makes High Beta stocks expensive (lower forward return).
Low Beta stocks are neglected (cheap).

### Definition 2.2 (BAB Construction)
Portfolio:
Long Low Beta (leveraged to Beta=1).
Short High Beta (de-leveraged to Beta=1).
Delta Neutral. Beta Neutral.
Captures the mispricing spread.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Lottery Preference
Retail investors love High Vol stocks (Tesla, Meme stocks).
Positive Skew preference (Small chance of 10x).
They overpay for volatility.
Low Vol stocks are boring. "Bond Proxies."

### 3.2 Interest Rate Sensitivity
Low Vol stocks (Utilities, Staples, REITs) are bond-like.
High correlation to duration.
If Rates Rise $\implies$ Low Vol underperforms?
Yes, "BAB" factor often has negative correlation to interest rates.
2022: Low Vol did okay relative to Tech, but suffered due to rate shock.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Minimum Variance Portfolio
MPT Optimization with only Risk constraint.
Result: Concentrated in Low Vol stocks.
Historically beats the Cap-Weighted Index.
Smart Beta ETFs (USMV, SPLV).

### 4.2 Crisis Performance
Low Vol draws down *less* in crashes.
Geometric compounding math: Losing 20% requires 25% gain to recover. Losing 50% requires 100%.
Avoiding large drawdowns is the secret to long-term wealth.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tracking Error):**
Low Vol portfolio has high Tracking Error to S&P 500.
In Bull Market (2020), Low Vol lags badly.
FOMO risk. Investors fire manager.
Agency problem.

**Exercise 2 (Valuation Check):**
Everyone knows the anomaly now.
Are Low Vol stocks expensive (High P/E)?
If yes, the forward premium might be zero.
Factor Timing.
