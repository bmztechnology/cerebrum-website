# Crack Spread Economics: The Refiner's Margin

## I. Executive Summary

The **Crack Spread** measures the profit margin of a refinery. It is the difference between the price of Crude Oil (Input) and the price of Refined Products (Gasoline, Diesel, Jet Fuel). The most common proxy is the **3-2-1 Crack Spread** (3 barrels of Crude $\to$ 2 barrels of Gasoline + 1 barrel of Distillate). Trading the Crack Spread allows investors to isolate Refining margins from Oil price risk.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (3-2-1 Formula)
$$Crack = \frac{2 \times P_{gas} + 1 \times P_{diesel} - 3 \times P_{crude}}{3}$$
Note: Prices must be converted to same units ($/barrel).
Gasoline trades in $/gallon. 42 gallons = 1 barrel.
If Margin > Operating Cost ($5/bbl), Refiner prints money.

### Definition 2.2 (Utilization Rate)
If Crack Spreads are high ($30/bbl in 2022), Refiners run at 95% capacity.
If Spreads are low ($5/bbl), they cut runs to 80%.
Self-correcting mechanism.
High Runs $\to$ Product Glut $\to$ Spreads Fall.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Diesel vs Gasoline Elasticity
-   **Gasoline:** Consumer driven. Elastic. High price $\to$ Less driving.
-   **Diesel:** Industrial driven. Inelastic. Trucks/Ships must move.
In a Recession, Diesel cracks collapse fast.
In an Inflationary Boom, Diesel cracks lead the way.

### 3.2 Refinery Complexity
Complex Refineries (Nelson Index > 10) can process cheap Heavy Sour crude into diesel.
Simple Refineries need expensive Light Sweet crude.
Complex refiners (Valero) outperform Simple refiners when the Light-Heavy spread widens.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Hurricane Season
Refineries concentrated in US Gulf Coast.
Hurricane threat $\to$ Shut downs.
Product Supply drops $\to$ Crack Spreads spike.
Crude Demand drops $\to$ Crude Price falls.
Trade: Long Crack Spread (Long Gas / Short Oil).

### 4.2 ESG & Capacity Constraints
No new refineries built in US/EU since 1970s.
Old ones closing (Conversion to Biofuel).
structural shortage of Refining Capacity.
Thesis: Crack Spreads will remain structurally higher than historical average. "Golden Age of Refining."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (IMO 2020):**
Regulations restricted Sulfur in ship fuel.
Ships switched to Marine Gasoil (Diesel).
Diesel demand spiked.
Diesel Crack exploded.
Regulatory shock.

**Exercise 2 (The Hedge):**
Airline needs Jet Fuel.
Correlation Jet Fuel vs Crude is 0.9.
But Crack Spread volatility can kill them.
Airlines hedge using Crude AND Heating Oil futures to proxy the crack.
