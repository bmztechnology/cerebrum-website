# War Finance: The Economics of Conflict

## I. Executive Summary

**War Finance** is the study of how nations mobilize resources for conflict. "Amateurs talk strategy, Professionals talk logistics." A war must be funded by Taxes, Debt, or Printing (Inflation). The method chosen dictates the post-war economic landscape. Modern warfare also involves "Financial Statecraft" (Attacking the enemy's currency and credit).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Inflationary Gap)
Keynes (How to Pay for the War).
Govt demand for goods explodes. Supply is constrained (bombed factories / diverted to tanks).
$Demand > Supply \implies$ Inflation.
Solution:
1.  **Rationing:** Price controls + Coupons.
2.  **War Bonds:** Soak up excess consumer liquidity.
3.  **Deferred Pay:** Force workers to save.

### Definition 2.2 (Monetization)
If the market won't buy War Bonds, the Central Bank buys them.
WWII: Fed pegged Treasuries at 2.5%.
Money Supply exploded.
Price Controls hid the inflation until 1947.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Peace Dividend
End of Cold War (1990) allowed massive defence cuts.
Resources shifted to Tech/Consumer.
Deflationary boom.
New Cold War (2022+) implies rising Defense Spending (2% $\to$ 4% GDP).
Inflationary drag.

### 3.2 Currency in War
Aggressor's currency usually collapses (Ruble 2022 initially, Hryvnia 2022).
Capital Controls introduced immediately (Ban FX sales).
Black Market Rate vs Official Rate divergence.
"Gresham's Law": Bad money drives out good. People hoard Dollars, spend locals.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Defense Stocks
Long Lockheed/Raytheon in times of geopolitical tension.
Recession-proof revenue (Government guaranteed).
Valuation expands as "ESG" stigma fades (Defense becomes "Socially Necessary").

### 4.2 Gold as War Insurance
Gold has no counterparty risk.
In a total collapse (Government falls), Fiat becomes worthless. Gold retains value.
Central Banks buying Gold in 2023 (Record levels) signals preparation for conflict/sanctions.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Russia's Fortress Balance Sheet):**
Before 2022, Russia built up $600B Reserves and Low Debt (20% GDP).
Prepared for Sanctions.
Mistake: Kept reserves in Euro/Dollar (Frozen).
Should have held Gold/Yuan only.

**Exercise 2 (Ukraine Aid):**
US allows Ukraine to run a massive deficit funded by US aid.
Essentially "Outsourced War Finance."
If aid stops, Ukraine must print Hyperinflation immediately.
