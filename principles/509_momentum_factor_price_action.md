# Momentum Factor Price Action: Winners

## I. Executive Summary

**Momentum (MOM)** is the tendency of assets that have performed well in the recent past (3-12 months) to continue performing well in the near future. Documented by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), it is the most robust and pervasive anomaly in finance, existing in Equities, Bonds, Currencies, and Commodities. It challenges the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and is often attributed to behavioral biases (Under-reaction / Over-reaction).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cross-Sectional Momentum)
Rank all stocks by 12-Month Return (skipping the most recent month to avoid mean reversion).
Long top decile (Winners). Short bottom decile (Losers).
Result: MOM Factor.
Zero-cost, market-neutral portfolio.

### Definition 2.2 (Time Series Momentum)
"Trend Following."
If Return > 0 (or Price > MA), Go Long.
If Return < 0, Go Short / Cash.
Absolute performance, not relative.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Behavioral Explanation
1.  **Under-reaction:** Good news hits. Analyts conservative. Price drifts up slowly. Momentum captures the drift.
2.  **Over-reaction (Herding):** Price moves up. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Retail piles in. Overshoot.
3.  **Disposition Effect:** Investors sell winners too early (slowing the rise) and hold losers too long (slowing the fall).

### 3.2 Momentum Crashes
MOM has huge negative skew.
In a market rebound (post-crash), Losers (Junk) rally hardest (Short Covering + Beta). Winners (Quality) lag.
MOM strategy crashes. (e.g., 2009, 2020).
"Running up the stairs, jumping out the window."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Value & Momentum Combo
Value and Momentum are negatively correlated.
Value buys cheap (Losers). Momentum buys expensive (Winners).
Combining them in a portfolio creates a massive diversification benefit.
"The only free lunch is diversifiying across factors."

### 4.2 Managed Futures (CTAs)
Trend Following funds.
Institutionalize Time Series Momentum.
Crisis Alpha (Perform well in 2008 and 2022).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Rebalancing Frequency):**
Monthly rebalancing is high turnover. Transaction costs can eat the Alpha.
Quarterly rebalancing is standard.

**Exercise 2 (The 1-Month Reversal):**
Short term (1 month) returns exhibit *reversal*, not momentum.
Liquidity provision. Market makers fade the move.
Momentum works on 3-12 month horizon.
