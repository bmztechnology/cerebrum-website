# Dopamine Reward Prediction Error

## I. Executive Summary

**Dopamine** is not the "Pleasure Molecule," but the **Prediction Error Molecule** ($RPE$). It spikes not when we get a reward, but when the reward is **Unexpected**. In trading, this creates an addiction to **Volatility** and **Surprise**. A predictable salary release little dopamine; a variable winning trade releases a flood. This biological mechanism explains why trading is addictive and why "boring is profitable."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Reward Prediction Error - RPE)
Schultz.
$RPE = Reward_{Received} - Reward_{Predicted}$.
If $RPE > 0$ (Positive Surprise) $\implies$ Dopamine Spike (Learn to repeat action).
If $RPE < 0$ (Disappointment) $\implies$ Dopamine Dip (Learn to avoid).
If $RPE = 0$ (Expected) $\implies$ Baseline.

### Definition 2.2 (The Near Miss)
Slot machines: 7-7-Lemon.
The brain treats 2/3rds of a jackpot not as a loss, but as a "signal of getting closer."
Dopamine spikes *more* for a near miss than a small win.
Traders getting stopped out by 1 tick often feel an urge to re-enter immediately (Chase).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Variable Ratio Reinforcement
Skinner.
RPE drives the addiction to "Random Rewards."
Markets are the ultimate Variable Ratio machine.
You press the button (Buy), sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
The uncertainty *maximizes* dopamine release compared to a guaranteed outcome.

### 3.2 Adaptation
The "Hedonic Treadmill."
Making \$1,000 feels amazing the first time ($RPE > 0$).
After 10 times, \$1,000 is "Expected" ($RPE = 0$).
To get the same high, the trader measures up to \$2,000 size.
Risk escalation is built into the neurochemistry.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Boring Trading
Good trading should be boring (George Soros).
Boring = Expected = Low RPE = Low Dopamine.
If you are excited, you are likely gambling.
Systems/Algos remove the RPE from the execution.

### 4.2 Dopamine Fasting
Disconnecting from the screen.
Reducing the frequency of checking PnL.
Resensitizing the receptors.
Allowing the brain to find satisfaction in steady, compounding returns rather than "Jackpots."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The PnL Hiding):**
Trade with PnL hidden (Trade off charts only).
Check PnL only at end of week.
Removes the intra-day Dopamine hits (and Cortisol spikes).

**Exercise 2 (The Surprise Journal):**
Record trades that were "Surprises."
Did you feel a rush?
That rush is the enemy of discipline.
