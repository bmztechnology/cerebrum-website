# Money Market Funds 2a7: The Buck

## I. Executive Summary

**Money Market Funds (MMFs)** connect cash savings to short-term borrowers (Government, Banks). Regulated under **Rule 2a-7**, they aim to maintain a Stable Net Asset Value (NAV) of \$1.00. The industry is split into **Government** (Risk-free, stable NAV) and **Prime** (Corporate/Bank debt, floating NAV). Structural vulnerabilities (First Mover Advantage in runs) led to major reforms in 2014 and 2023.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Breaking the Buck)
If underlying asset value drops (e.g., Lehman default), NAV < \$0.995.
Fund must liquidate or freeze redemptions.
Triggers panic.
Happened only twice (1994, 2008).

### Definition 2.2 (Liquidity Gates and Fees)
Old Rule: If Weekly Liquid Assets < 30%, Fund *can* impose gates/fees.
Unintended Consequence: Investors ran *before* the 30% line was crossed (2020 dash for cash).
New Rule (2023): Removed Gates tie. Imposed **Swing Pricing** / Liquidity Fees on selling shareholders to internalize the cost of liquidity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 WAM and WAL
-   **WAM (Weighted Average Maturity):** Max 60 days. Sensitivity to rates.
-   **WAL (Weighted Average Life):** Max 120 days. Sensitivity to spreads.
Strict limits to ensure safety.

### 3.2 The Shadow Bank Bank Run
MMFs function like banks (Demand Deposits, Long assets).
But no Capital and no Deposit Insurance.
Vulnerable to runs.
US Treasury Guarantee (2008, 2020) stopped the panic.
Moral hazard: Industry relies on Govt backstop?

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 RRP Usage
Gov MMFs are the primary users of the Fed's ON RRP.
Pass through the Fed's floor rate to retail investors.
Disintermediate banks (who pay 0.01% on deposits).

### 4.2 Prime Fund Death
Reforms made Prime funds unattractive (Floating NAV, Swing Pricing).
Assets shifted massively to Gov Funds.
Reduced funding for CP and CDs (Bank/Corporate borrowing).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Repo conduits):**
MMFs lend via Repo.
Banks borrow via Repo.
Symbiosis.
If MMFs pull back (Run), Dealer funding collapses.

**Exercise 2 (Daily Liquidity):**
Requirement: 10% Daily Liquid Assets (Govt).
If massive redemption request hits, must sell Treasuries.
Treasury market volatility impact.
