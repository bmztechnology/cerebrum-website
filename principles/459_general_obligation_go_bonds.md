# General Obligation GO Bonds: Full Faith

## I. Executive Summary

**General Obligation (GO)** Bonds are backed by the **Full Faith and Credit** and **Taxing Power** of the issuer (State, City, County). They are considered the safest type of Muni (historically). Repayment is supported by **Ad Valorem** (Property) taxes, Income taxes, and Sales taxes. Key distinction: **Unlimited Tax GO** (can raise taxes infinitely to pay) vs **Limited Tax GO**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Pledge)
Legal obligation: "Issuer promises to levy taxes sufficient to pay debt service."
Statutory Lien: In some states (RI), bondholders have a lien on tax revenues.
Priority: In bankruptcy (Chapter 9), are GOs senior to Pensions? (The Detroit Question).
Usually, Yes (in theory), but often treated equally (in practice).

### Definition 2.2 (Assessed Valuation - AV)
Value of all property in the jurisdiction.
Levy = Debt Service / AV.
If AV drops (Real Estate crash), Tax Rate must rise.
"Taxpayer Revolt" risk.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 State vs Local
-   **States:** Sovereign-ish. Cannot go bankrupt (Chapter 9 does not apply to States). Cannot be sued easily. Rely on Income/Sales tax (Volatile).
-   **Locals:** Cities/Counties. Can file Chapter 9. Rely on Property Tax (Stable).

### 3.2 Default History
Rare.
Great Depression: 10% default rate.
Post-WWII: < 0.1% default rate.
Exceptions: NYC (1975), Detroit (2013), Puerto Rico (2016).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Geo-Diversification
Don't buy only your home state.
"Concentration Risk."
If local economy crashes $\implies$ Job loss + Home value drop + Bond default.
Triple whammy.

### 4.2 Evaluating Pensions
Unfunded Pension Liability.
"Soft Debt."
Add Net Pension Liability to Bonded Debt to get "Total Fixed Costs."
Chicago: High Debt + Massive Pension Hole = Junk quality GO.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Moral Obligation):**
State not legally bound to pay, but "Moral" commitment.
Appropriation risk (Legislature must vote to pay every year).
Yield > GO.

**Exercise 2 (Note Market):**
TANs (Tax Anticipation Notes).
RANs (Revenue Anticipation Notes).
Short term cash flow management.
Very safe if cash flows are predictable.
