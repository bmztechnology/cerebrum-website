# Elliott Wave Theory: Fractal Market Structure

## I. Historical Background

Ralph Nelson Elliott developed this theory in the 1930s, observing that market prices unfold in specific patterns reflecting crowd psychology. The patterns are fractal, appearing at all timeframes.

## II. Basic Wave Structure

### Definition 2.1 (Impulse Wave)
A 5-wave pattern moving in the direction of the larger trend:
$$Impulse = Wave1 + Wave2 + Wave3 + Wave4 + Wave5$$

- Waves 1, 3, 5: Motive waves (trend direction)
- Waves 2, 4: Corrective waves (counter-trend)

### Definition 2.2 (Corrective Wave)
A 3-wave pattern moving against the larger trend:
$$Correction = WaveA + WaveB + WaveC$$

### 2.3 Complete Cycle
One complete cycle = 8 waves (5 impulse + 3 corrective)

## III. Wave Rules (Inviolable)

### Rule 3.1 (Wave 2)
Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of Wave 1:
$$Low_{Wave2} > Low_{Wave1}$$ (in uptrend)

### Rule 3.2 (Wave 3)
Wave 3 is never the shortest impulse wave:
$$|Wave3| > \min(|Wave1|, |Wave5|)$$

### Rule 3.3 (Wave 4)
Wave 4 never enters the price territory of Wave 1:
$$Low_{Wave4} > High_{Wave1}$$ (in uptrend)

## IV. Wave Guidelines (Often But Not Always)

### 4.1 Fibonacci Relationships
| Wave | Common Fibonacci Ratios |
|------|------------------------|
| Wave 2 | 50%, 61.8% of Wave 1 |
| Wave 3 | 161.8%, 200%, 261.8% of Wave 1 |
| Wave 4 | 38.2%, 50% of Wave 3 |
| Wave 5 | 61.8%, 100% of Wave 1, or 161.8% of Wave 1-3 |

### 4.2 Alternation
If Wave 2 is simple, Wave 4 tends to be complex (and vice versa):
$$Complexity(Wave2) \approx \neg Complexity(Wave4)$$

### 4.3 Wave Equality
If Wave 3 extends, Waves 1 and 5 tend to be equal:
$$|Wave3| >> |Wave1| \Rightarrow |Wave5| \approx |Wave1|$$

## V. Corrective Patterns

### 5.1 Zigzag (5-3-5)
Sharp correction:
$$A = 5 waves, B = 3 waves, C = 5 waves$$
$$C \approx 100\% \text{ or } 161.8\% \text{ of } A$$

### 5.2 Flat (3-3-5)
Sideways correction:
$$A = 3 waves, B = 3 waves, C = 5 waves$$
$$B \approx 100\% \text{ of } A$$

#### 5.2.1 Regular Flat
$$High_B \approx High_{origin}, Low_C \approx Low_A$$

#### 5.2.2 Expanded Flat
$$High_B > High_{origin}, Low_C < Low_A$$

### 5.3 Triangle (3-3-3-3-3)
Contracting pattern before final wave:
$$ABCDE \text{ with progressively smaller swings}$$

Usually appears in Wave 4 or Wave B position.

## VI. Degree Notation

### 6.1 Wave Degrees
From largest to smallest:
1. Grand Supercycle
2. Supercycle
3. Cycle
4. Primary
5. Intermediate
6. Minor
7. Minute
8. Minuette
9. Subminuette

### 6.2 Fractal Nature
$$Wave_n \text{ at degree } d = Complete_{5-3} \text{ at degree } d-1$$

Each wave contains subwaves.

## VII. Practical Application

### 7.1 Wave Counting
Algorithm:
1. Identify largest clear pattern
2. Apply rules to validate
3. Subdivide into smaller degrees
4. Project targets using Fibonacci

### 7.2 Trade Entry Points
**Best entries:**
- End of Wave 2 (buy for Wave 3)
- End of Wave 4 (buy for Wave 5)
- End of Wave A or B (corrective structure)

### 7.3 Invalidation Levels
Set stops at wave rule violations:
- Wave 2 stop: Below Wave 1 start
- Wave 4 stop: At Wave 1 high

## VIII. Criticisms and Limitations

### 8.1 Subjectivity
Wave counts are subjective; different analysts may see different patterns.

### 8.2 Hindsight Bias
Patterns appear clearer in retrospect than real-time.

### 8.3 Falsifiability
Theory difficult to disprove as alternative counts always exist.

## IX. Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Identify the wave rule violated: Wave 2 retraces 110% of Wave 1.

**Exercise 2:** If Wave 1 = 100 pips and Wave 3 = 200 pips, calculate Wave 5 targets using Fibonacci.

**Exercise 3:** Given a zigzag correction with Wave A = 80 pips, calculate probable Wave C targets.

**Exercise 4:** Why must Wave 3 not be the shortest? Explain the logic.
