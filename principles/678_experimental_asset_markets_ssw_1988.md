# Experimental Asset Markets SSW 1988

## I. Executive Summary

**Experimental Asset Markets** (Smith, Suchanek, Williams 1988) was the seminal study proving that **Bubbles** and **Crashes** occur even in laboratory settings where the "Fundamental Value" is perfectly known and public. This demolished the idea that bubbles are caused by "Uncertainty" about fundamentals. It proved that speculation is intrinsic to human market interaction.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The SSW Design)
Asset pays dividend $d = \$0.24$ per period for 15 periods.
Fundamental Value at period $t$: $FV_t = \$0.24 \times (16 - t)$.
$FV$ declines linearly to \$0.
Rational Price = $FV$.
Observed Price: Starts below FV (Risk aversion), then rallies WAY above FV (Bubble), then crashes below FV near the end.

### Definition 2.2 (The Bubble Measure)
$$ BO = \frac{Price_{Max} - FV_{Max}}{FV_{Max}} $$
Bubbles form in 70-80% of experiments with novice subjects.
Experts (Wall Street traders) produce *larger* bubbles than students (Confidence?).
Only repeated experience (3rd time playing) eliminates the bubble.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Speculative Demand
Why buy at \$3.00 when FV is \$2.00?
Because you expect to sell at \$3.50.
"The Greater Fool Theory."
Participants know the asset is overvalued but think they can beat the clock.
Speculation overrides valuation.

### 3.2 Confusion vs Speculation
Lei, Noussair, Plott (2001).
Restricted resale (No speculation allowed).
Bubbles still formed (smaller).
Suggests "Active Confusion" / Irrationality plays a role alongside speculation.
We just don't know how to price decreasing assets.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Market Experience
Experience is the only cure.
Novices always bubble.
Implication: Every new generation of traders (Crypto Gen Z) must blow up an account to learn valuation.
"Tuition."

### 4.2 Dividend Certainty
If dividends are uncertain (Real world), bubbles arguably easier to justify.
But SSW proved bubbles happen with *Certain* dividends.
Therefore, "Fundamental Clarity" (Regulation/Disclosure) will not stop bubbles.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Backward Induction):**
At Period 15, Price must be 0 (After dividend).
At Period 14, Price must be $E[d]$.
Unraveling from the end.
Humans are bad at backward induction. We look forward (Momentum).

**Exercise 2 (Short Selling constraints):**
In SSW, shorting is hard/impossible.
Does adding short selling kill the bubble?
Experiments say: It reduces, but doesn't eliminate.
Shorts can get squeezed (margin calls).
