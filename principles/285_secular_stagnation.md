# Secular Stagnation: The Low Growth Trap

## I. Executive Summary

**Secular Stagnation** (Lawrence Summers, 2013) hypothesizes that the Natural Rate of Interest ($r^*$) has fallen below zero due to a chronic excess of Savings over Investment. Caused by Demographics (Aging), Inequality (Rich save), and Technology (Capital is cheap). Result: Structural low growth, low inflation, and reliance on Asset Bubbles to generate demand.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Natural Rate $r^*$)
The interest rate consistent with Full Employment and Stable Inflation.
If $r^* = -2\%$.
And ZLB limits Nominal Rate to 0%.
Real Rate = 0% - Inflation.
If Inflation is low, Real Rate > $r^*$.
Monetary Policy is permanently too tight.

### Definition 2.2 (Savings Glut)
Global Savings (China, Germany, Boomers) > Investment Opportunities (Software is cheap, don't need factories).
Excess savings bid up asset prices (Real Estate, Stocks) instead of funding capex.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Gordon's Headwinds
Robert Gordon.
Growth is over.
1870-1970: Laundry, Electricity, Toilet, Engine. Massive productivity.
1970-2020: Internet. Useful, but not same scale of life improvement?
Future headwinds: Debt, Demographics, Inequality, Education.
Productivity growth $\to$ 0.

### 3.2 The Bubble Dependency
If normal demand is weak.
Only "Wealth Effect" from bubbles (Dotcom, Housing) can drive full employment.
Fed *must* blow bubbles to hit mandate.
Financial Instability is a feature, not a bug.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long Duration Assets
In Secular Stagnation, Yields stay low.
Growth stocks (Tech) valuations expand (DCF denominator low).
Real Estate yields compress.
"Lower for Longer."

### 4.2 Regime Change?
Did COVID break Stagnation?
Fiscal Stimulus + Green Capex + Re-shoring + Labor Shortage.
$r^*$ might be rising.
If so, the "Long Duration" trade (Big Tech) is vulnerable.
Trend shift 2020-2030?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Japan as Precursor):**
Japan has been in Secular Stagnation since 1990.
The West followed 20 years later.
Japan teaches: Fiscal deficits will be permanent to bridge the demand gap.

**Exercise 2 (Crypto Thesis):**
If Stagnation forces constant money printing to support asset prices.
Crypto is the hedge against the debasement required to sustain the stagnation.
