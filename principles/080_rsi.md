# Relative Strength Index (RSI): Internal Strength

## I. Executive Summary

The Relative Strength Index (RSI), also by Welles Wilder, is the most popular momentum oscillator in the world. Unlike Stochastics (which uses High/Low range), RSI looks strictly at the **velocity of change** of Closing prices. It measures the ratio of Up-Moves to Down-Moves. It is an index of "Internal Strength" normalized 0-100.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Relative Strength - RS)
$$RS = \frac{AvgGain}{AvgLoss}$$
Where:
-   $AvgGain = \frac{\sum Gains}{14}$ (Smoothed).
-   $AvgLoss = \frac{\sum Losses}{14}$ (Smoothed, absolute value).

### Definition 2.2 (The RSI Formula)
$$RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right)$$
*Note:* As $RS \to \infty$ (Only gains, no losses), $RSI \to 100$. As $RS \to 0$, $RSI \to 0$.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Range Shift Theory (Andrew Cardwell)
RSI does not oscillate evenly around 50. It shifts ranges based on Trend.
-   **Bull Market Range:** RSI fluctuates between 40 and 80. Support is 40.
-   **Bear Market Range:** RSI fluctuates between 20 and 60. Resistance is 60.
*Application:* If RSI hits 30, it indicates the Bull Trend might be broken (Shift to Bear Range).

### 3.2 Failure Swings
A reversal pattern that occurs *on the indicator itself*, ignoring price.
-   **Bullish Failure Swing:**
    1.  RSI drops below 30 (Oversold).
    2.  RSI bounces to 40.
    3.  RSI pulls back but holds at 32 (Higher Low).
    4.  RSI breaks 40.
    *Signal:* Buy immediately (often precedes price breakout).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The 50-Level Cross
In a trending market, the 50 level acts as support/resistance.
-   **Bull Entry:** Price bounces off MA, RSI bounces off 50.
-   **Bear Entry:** Price rallies to resistance, RSI rejects off 50.

### 4.2 Divergence (Class A)
-   Price Higher High. RSI Lower High.
-   *Trigger:* wait for RSI to break the trendline connecting the two highs.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Calculation Sensitivity):**
Day 1: Gain \$2.
Day 2: Gain \$2.
Day 3: Loss \$0.
AvgGain = 2. AvgLoss = 0.
RS goes to infinity. RSI = 100.
Day 4: Loss \$10.
How much does RSI drop? (Rapidly, because AvgLoss spikes from denominator).

**Exercise 2 (Comparison):**
Why is RSI smoother than Stochastics?
(RSI uses an averaging technique on Closes. Stochastics uses raw High/Low range which is noisy).

**Exercise 3 (Regime):**
RSI is stuck between 40 and 60 for 2 weeks.
What is the Price Action doing? (Consolidation/Triangle).
What is likely to happen? (Volatility squeeze explosion).
