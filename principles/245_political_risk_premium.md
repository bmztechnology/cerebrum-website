# Political Risk Premium: Pricing the Regime

## I. Executive Summary

**Political Risk** is the probability that political decisions/events will cause investment losses. In Developed Markets, politics is "Noise." In Emerging Markets, politics is "The Driver." Risks include Expropriation, Capital Controls, Regulatory Changes, and Civil Unrest. Investors demand a risk premium (higher yield/lower P/E) to hold assets in unstable regimes.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Risk Spectrum)
-   **Policy Volatility:** Tax changes, sector regulation (China Tech Crackdown).
-   **Regime Instability:** Coups, Riots (Peru, Pakistan).
-   **Expropriation:** Nationalization of assets (Venezuela Oil, Russia Utilities).

### Definition 2.2 (Sovereign Thread - CDS)
Credit Default Swaps price Political Risk.
Brazil CDS spikes when Lula usually speaks.
Pricing: $Spread = Probability(Default) \times (1 - Recovery)$.
Political Risk drives the Probability term.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Median Voter Theorem vs Populism
Standard theory: Politicians move to center to win.
EM Reality: Extreme Inequality drives polarization.
Lula vs Bolsonaro. Left vs Right.
"Binary Outcomes."
Assets reprice 50% overnight depending on election result.

### 3.2 Institutional Strength
Acemoglu.
Extractive Institutions (Dictators) vs Inclusive Institutions (Democracy).
Long term, only Inclusive grow.
Short term, Dictators can force high growth (China model).
But Dictators have "Key Man Risk."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Event Driven Trading
Elections.
Option Straddles are expensive.
Directional Bet: Polling analysis.
Argentina 2019 (PASO Primary): Market expected Macri win. Peronists won. Merval Index fell 48% in one day (2nd largest crash in world history).
Risk Management: Never hold unhedged EM into an election.

### 4.2 The "Reform Trade"
Market loves a reformer (Milei in Argentina, Modi in India).
"Hope trade."
Buy when Reformer is elected.
Sell when reality of bureaucracy sets in.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Russia 2000-2022):**
Cheap P/E (4x).
Investors assumed "Political Discount" was too high.
2022: Value went to zero.
The "Discount" was actually accurate.
Cheap for a reason.

**Exercise 2 (ESG Conflict):**
Governance (G) is the Political Risk factor.
China scores low on G.
Investors ignored G for Growth.
Tech crackdown wiped $2 Trillion.
G matters.
