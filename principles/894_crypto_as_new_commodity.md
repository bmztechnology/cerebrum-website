# Crypto as the New Commodity

## I. Executive Summary

**Crypto Assets** (Bitcoin, Ethereum) have evolved from "Magic Internet Money" to an Institutional Asset Class, legally classified (mostly) as **Commodities**. The microstructure mirrors physical commodities: **Mining** (Production cost), **Halving** (Supply shock), and **Futures** (Hedging). The synthesis places Crypto as "Digital Gold" - a non-sovereign store of value and collateral.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Digital Scarcity)
Bitcoin Cap: 21 Million.
Stock-to-Flow Ratio (SF) increases every 4 years (Halving).
Hardest money in existence (Supply inelastic to price).
Unlike Gold: If Gold price $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Mining $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Supply $\uparrow$.
Bitcoin: Price $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Mining $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Difficulty $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Supply Constant.

### Definition 2.2 (The ETF Bridge)
Spot ETFs (BlackRock IBIT).
Bridge between TradFi (Brokerage accounts) and DeFi (Blockchain).
Removes custody risk (Cold storage by Coinbase).
Allows Pension Funds to allocate 1% via standard rails.
Financialization of the commodity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Correlation Dynamics
Risk-On or Risk-Off?
2020-2022: Bitcoin Correlated with Nasdaq (High Beta Tech).
2023 Banking Crisis: Bitcoin rallied (Bank hedge?).
Narrative shift: "Schrodinger's Asset."
Long-term thesis: Uncorrelated to fiat debasement.

### 3.2 Yield Farming vs Risk Free Rate
DeFi Yields (5-10%) vs T-Bills (5%).
DeFi Yield comes from:
1. Borrow demand (Leverage).
2. Token emission (Inflation).
If T-Bills > DeFi Yield $\implies$ TVL leaves Crypto (2022).
If T-Bills < DeFi Yield $\implies$ TVL enters Crypto.
Interest rate parity.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 24/7 Liquidity
Crypto never seeks.
Liquidation cascade on Sunday at 3am.
Price discovery leads TradFi.
"The canary in the coal mine" for global liquidity conditions.

### 4.2 Stablecoin Treasuries
Tether/Circle hold \$100B in T-Bills.
Top 20 holder of US Debt.
Crypto is funding the US Government.
Geopolitical implication: Dollarization of the internet via Stablecoins.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The MicroStrategy Lever):**

Leveraged Bitcoin ETF.
Premium to NAV due to inability of some funds to hold Spot BTC.

**Exercise 2 (Miner Capitulation):**
Price drops below Cost of Production.
Miners sell holding. Shut down rigs.
Hashrate drops. Difficulty adjusts.
Equilibrium restored.
Commodity cycle theory.
