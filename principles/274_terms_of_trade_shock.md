# Terms of Trade Shock: The Income Effect

## I. Executive Summary

**Terms of Trade (ToT)** shocks represent a massive transfer of wealth between nations. $ToT = P_{export} / P_{import}$. If you export Oil and import Food, and Oil prices double, your country gets richer without working harder. This drives the **commodity currency** phenomenon (AUD, CAD, NOK).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Shock)
1.  Russia invades Ukraine.
2.  Gas Prices $10x.
3.  Europe (Importer): Huge Negative ToT Shock. Real Income collapses. Euro falls.
4.  Norway (Exporter): Huge Positive ToT Shock. Wealth explodes. Krone rises.

### Definition 2.2 (Prebisch-Singer Revisited)
Long term decline of commodity terms of trade?
Volatility is the bigger issue.
ToT volatility hinders long-term planning in EMs.
Solution: Sovereign Wealth Funds (Smooth the shock).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Harberger-Laursen-Metzler Effect
Positive ToT shock $\to$ Real Income $\uparrow$ $\to$ Savings $\uparrow$?
Or Consumption $\uparrow$?
If shock is "Temporary," Savings rise (Consumption smoothing).
If shock is "Permanent," Consumption rises.
Typically, EMs treat temporary oil booms as permanent (Spending spree) $\to$ Crisis when price falls.

### 3.2 Dutch Disease Mechanism
ToT Boom $\to$ Currency Appreciation.
Non-commodity exports (Manufacturing) become uncompetitive.
De-industrialization.
When ToT mean reverts, the Industry is gone.
Permanent scar.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the Cross
Long NOK / Short SEK.
Norway (Oil) vs Sweden (Industrial/Tech).
When Oil rallies, this spread widens.
Purest ToT trade in G10 FX.

### 4.2 Energy Importers
Japan, India, Turkey.
Oil Spike = Tax on Economy.
Short INR when Oil breaks $100.
Their Current Account degrades immediately.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Australia 2011):**
Coal/Iron Ore boom.
ToT highest in history.
AUD > USD.
RBA (Central Bank) had to keep rates high to cool the mining inflation.
Perfect storm for Carry Trade.

**Exercise 2 (Counter-Intuitive USD):**
US is now a Net Energy Exporter.
Historically, Oil Up $\to$ USD Down (Cost to US consumer).
Now, Oil Up $\to$ USD Up (US Terms of Trade improve vs Europe/Japan).
Correlations have flipped post-Shale Revolution.
