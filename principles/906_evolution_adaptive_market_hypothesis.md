# Evolution Adaptive Market Hypothesis

## I. Executive Summary

**The Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH)** by Andrew Lo unifies EMH and Behaviorism. Markets are an **Ecosystem**. Strategies are **Species**. Regulation is the **Environment**. When the environment changes (Volcker Rule, ZIRP), some species die (Prop Desks), and others thrive (Private Credit). There is no "Final Equilibrium," only **Constant Adaptation**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Rate of Adaptation)
Markets are efficient *relative* to the speed of adaptation.
Shark (HFT) eats slow fish (Retail). Use of meat evolves.
If Prey evolves (wises up), Shark must evolve (AI).
Arms race.
Efficiency is not a state, it is a process.

### Definition 2.2 (The Ecology of Arbitrage)
Herbivores: Index Funds (Eat Beta).
Carnivores: Hedge Funds (Eat Alpha/Inefficiency).
Decomposers: Vulture Funds (Eat Dead Companies).
If Carnivores die out (Capital outflow), Herbivores overpopulate (Bubbles).
System needs predators to be healthy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regime Switching
Regime A: Low Vol, Low Rates (2010-2020).
Winning Species: Risk Parity, Long Tech, Private Equity.
Regime B: High Vol, High Inflation (2020s).
Winning Species: Trend Following, Commodities, Short Duration.
Species from Regime A go extinct in Regime B unless they adapt.
"Past performance is not indicative of future results" because the environment changed.

### 3.2 Behavioral Evolution
Heuristics (Fear/Greed) evolved for the Savannah (Run from Lion).
Useful for survival.
Bad for trading (Selling at bottom).
But maybe Fear prevents total ruin?
Biases are "Ecologically Rational" even if logically irrational.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Crisis Alpha
When the ecosystem catches fire (Correlation = 1).
Most species die.
Crisis Alpha strategies (Long Vol) are the "Pyrophytic Plants" (seeds sprout in fire).
Portfolio needs a mix of Fair Weather and Storm species.

### 4.2 Regulatory Impact
2008 Regulation (Dodd-Frank) killed Prop Trading in banks.
Did the risk disappear?
No, it migrated to Hedge Funds (Shadow Banks).
Evolutionary migration.
Regulators are always one step behind the mutation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Quant Quake 2007):**
Crowded trade (Standard Mean Reversion).
One big fund liquidated.
Caused price moves that triggered others.
Ecosystem collapse.
Survivors adapted by adding "Liquidity Factors" to models.

**Exercise 2 (AI in Finance):**
New invasive species.
Faster, smarter, no emotion.
Will it eat all the Alpha?
Or will it create new forms of noise (adversarial AI loops)?
The next stage of financial evolution.
