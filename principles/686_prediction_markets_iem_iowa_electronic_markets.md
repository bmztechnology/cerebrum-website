# Prediction Markets Iowa Electronic Markets

## I. Executive Summary

**Prediction Markets** (e.g., Iowa Electronic Markets, Polymarket, Kalshi) allow participants to trade contracts paying out based on future events (Elections, Fed Rates). These markets consistently outperform polls and expert pundits. They aggregate diverse information and incentivize truth-telling via the **Price Mechanism**, serving as the purest application of the **Hayek Hypothesis**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Binary Contracts)
Pays \$1 if Event Happens, \$0 if not.
Price $P$ reflects the market's consensus probability: $P \approx Probability(Event)$.
If Trump Trading at \$0.45 $\implies$ 45% chance of win.
Arbitrage forces $P$ to true probability.

### Definition 2.2 (The Hayek Hypothesis)
Prices are information signals.
Prediction markets extract the "Wisdom of Crowds" (Surowiecki).
Beats experts because experts have biases/ego. The Crowd cancels out individual noise.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Marginal Trader Hypothesis
Forsythe (1992).
The market is not efficient because everyone is smart.
It is efficient because a subset of "Marginal Travelers" (Arbs) exploit the biases of the noise traders.
Only a few smart traders are needed to set the correct price.
Voter bias (Trading who you *want* to win) creates the spread for the Arbs.

### 3.2 Limits to Prediction
Insider Trading (Political assassination markets?).
Manipulation (Buying votes to sway perception).
Thin liquidity.
However, empirical record shows high accuracy (e.g., Predicting Oscar winners, Election outcomes).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Corporate Prediction Markets
Google / Ford internal markets.
"Will the project launch on time?"
Managers say Yes (Optimism).
Prediction Market says No (Engineers betting against the deadline).
Truth serum for management.

### 4.2 Hedging Real World Risk
Hedging "Brexit."
Betting on "Leave" to offset business risk.
Prediction markets complete the market for "Event Risks."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Favorite-Longshot Bias):**
Observed in horse racing and prediction markets.
Favorites are underpriced. Longshots are overpriced.
People love the lottery ticket (100:1 odds).
Smart money bets on favorites.

**Exercise 2 (Calibration):**
Check track record.
Do events priced at 0.70 happen 70% of the time?
Prediction markets show excellent calibration.
Pundits show terrible calibration ("I'm 100% sure").
