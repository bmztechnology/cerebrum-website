# Distressed Debt Trading: The Vulture Game

## I. Executive Summary

**Distressed Debt Trading** involves buying the securities (Bonds, Loans, CDS) of companies in or near **Bankruptcy (Chapter 11)**. The goal is not usually yield, but **Capital Appreciation** or **Loan-to-Own** (Converting debt into controlling equity in the reorganized company). It requires intense legal analysis of **Covenants**, **Priority**, and **Intercreditor Agreements**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Fulcrum Security)
The security in the capital structure where the value "breaks."
Value of Firm = \$500M.
Senior Debt = \$300M (Covered).
Junior Debt = \$400M (Partially Covered).
Equity = \$0.
Junior Debt is the Fulcrum. They will become the New Equity owners.
Trading Strategy: Buy the Fulcrum. Short the Equity.

### Definition 2.2 (Blocking Position)
Chapter 11 Plan requires vote (2/3 of amount, 1/2 of number).
Acquiring 33.4% of a tranche gives "Blocking Power."
Force a better deal.
"Holdout Value."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Bankruptcy Valuation (Enterprise Value)
The fight is over EV.
Senior Creditors argue EV is low (So they get 100% of New Equity, wipe out Juniors).
Junior Creditors argue EV is high (So there is value left for them).
Battle of Expert Witnesses / DCF models / Comparables.

### 3.2 The J-Curve
Price drops into bankruptcy filing (Panic).
Stagnates during legal process ("The tedious middle").
Rises upon Plan Confirmation and Exit (Liquidity premium returns).
Buy at filing, sell at exit.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Basis Trades (Capital Structure)
Buy Senior / Short Junior.
If recoveries are lower than expected, Senior outperforms relative.
Gap trade.

### 4.2 GGB (Government Guaranteed Bonds)
Buying Greek debt at 20 cents.
Pari Passu clauses.
Litigation finance (Elliott Management vs Argentina).
Buying the paper solely to sue for full payment.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Equitable Subordination):**
Risk that a creditor's claim is pushed down in priority because of "Bad Acts" (Predatory lending, undue influence).
Distressed traders must be careful not to act like "Insiders."

**Exercise 2 (Credit Bidding):**
Secured Creditor uses the face value of debt to "bid" for the assets at auction.
Prevents assets being sold too cheap.
Floor on valuation.
