# Nudge Theory Libertarian Paternalism

## I. Executive Summary

**Nudge Theory** (Thaler & Sunstein) proposes that "Choice Architects" can influence behavior in predictable ways without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. A **Nudge** (e.g., fruit at eye level) alters behavior, while a **Mandate** (banning junk food) forbids choice. **Libertarian Paternalism** is the philosophy: Guide people to better choices (Paternalism) but leave them free to opt-out (Libertarian).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Choice Architecture)
The environment in which decisions are made.
There is no "Neutral" design.
Listing healthy food first increases selection by 25%.
Listing "Most Popular" fund increases selection.
The Architect (Employer, Government, App Designer) has immense power.

### Definition 2.2 (System 1 Targeting)
Nudges work on System 1 (Intuitive, Lazy).
They utilize biases (Status Quo, Social Proof) for good.
"Make it Easy" (Remove friction).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Defaults (The Iron Rule)
If you do nothing, what happens?
The Default is the strongest Nudge.
Auto-enrollment in pension.
Auto-renewal of subscription.
Opt-in vs Opt-out Organ Donation.

### 3.2 Feedback
Digital Nudges.
"You are spending more than average on dining out."
Real-time feedback loops correct behavior.
"Ambient Information" (Red light on dashboard).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Savings Policy
The Pension Protection Act of 2006.
Encouraged Auto-Enrollment + Auto-Escalation.
Result: Participation rates rose from 60% to 90%.
Trillions of dollars of wealth created by a Nudge.

### 4.2 Trading Interfaces
"Gamification" (Bad Nudge / Sludge).
Confetti on trade.
"Friction" (Good Nudge?).
"Cooling off period" before buying crypto.
UK FCA implementing "Positive Frictions" to protect retail.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Fly in the Urinal):**
Famous example.
Etched fly target reduces spillage by 80%.
Low cost, high impact.
What is the "Fly" for trading? (Maybe a "Total Fees Paid" ticker?).

**Exercise 2 (Sludge Audit):**
Identified processes that are intentionally hard.
Canceling a gym membership.
Sludge prevents beneficial action.
Regulatory trend: "Canceling must be as easy as Signing up."
