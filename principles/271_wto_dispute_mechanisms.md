# WTO Dispute Mechanisms: The Trade Court

## I. Executive Summary

The **World Trade Organization (WTO)** is the referee of global trade. Its core principles are **First MFN (Most Favored Nation)** (Treat everyone equal) and **National Treatment** (Treat foreigners like locals). When rules are broken (Subsidies, Dumping), members sue in the Dispute Settlement Body. US paralysis of the Appellate Body since 2019 has weakened this court, creating a "Power-based" rather than "Rules-based" order.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (MFN - Article I)
If US lowers tariff on German cars to 0%, it MUST lower tariff on Japanese/Chinese/Brazilian cars to 0% immediately.
 Exception: Free Trade Agreements (NAFTA/EU).
MFN prevents bilateral favors (mostly).

### Definition 2.2 (Anti-Dumping - AD)
If China sells Steel in US at price likely below cost.
US can impose AD Duties (Tariffs) to offset the "Dump."
Calculation: $Normal Value - Export Price = Margin$.
Duty = Margin.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Countervailing Duties (CVD)
Against Subsidies.
If Chinese Govt gives free land/electricity to Solar panel maker.
That is an unfair subsidy.
US imposes CVD Tariff.
Difference between AD (Company pricing behavior) and CVD (Govt subsidy behavior).

### 3.2 The Appellate Body Crisis
US blocked appointment of judges.
"Judicial Overreach."
Result: Cases go into void.
Countries appeal to empty court.
Enforcement breaks down.
Return to "Law of the Jungle" (Tariffs).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Solar Panel Wars
US imposed AD/CVD on Chinese Solar.
Chinese manufacturers moved to Vietnam/Malaysia.
US Dept of Commerce investigated "Circumvention."
result: Tariffs applied to Vietnam exports too.
Supply Chain uncertainty kills projects.

### 4.2 Boeing vs Airbus
Longest dispute in history (17 years).
Both sides subsidized their titans.
WTO ruled BOTH guilty.
Authorized tariffs.
Finally settled in 2021 ("truce") to fight China (COMAC).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (National Security Exception - Article XXI):**
Trump used "National Security" to put tariffs on Steel (and threatened Cars).
WTO usually defers to National Security claims.
Pandora's Box: If everything is National Security (e.g., Tik Tok), WTO rules don't apply.

**Exercise 2 (Retaliation):**
When US put tariffs on EU Steel.
EU put tariffs on Harley Davidson and Bourbon.
Focused on Swing States (Wisconsin/Kentucky) to hurt Mitch McConnell/Paul Ryan.
Political targeting of trade war.
