# Global Value Chains: The Smile Curve

## I. Executive Summary

**Global Value Chains (GVCs)** fragment production across borders. The iPhone is "Designed in California, Assembled in China." The distribution of value capture is described by the **Smile Curve**: High value in R&D/Branding (upstream) and Services/Marketing (downstream). Low value in Manufacturing/Assembly (midstream). This explains why "Making things" doesn't necessarily make a nation rich.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Smile Curve - Stan Shih)
Y-axis: Value Added. X-axis: Production Stage.
-   **Left (Concept):** R&D, Design, IP. (High Value - US/EU).
-   **Middle (Fabrication):** Assembly, Logistics. (Low Value - China/Vietnam).
-   **Right (Market):** Branding, Sales, After-care. (High Value - US/EU).
China wants to move up the edges (Design + Brand) via "Made in China 2025."

### Definition 2.2 (Bullwhip Effect)
Small fluctuations in consumer demand cause massive fluctuations in upstream supply chain orders.
Retailer sees +5% demand. Orders +10% (Buffer).
Wholesaler orders +20%.
Factory builds +40% capacity.
Inventory glut follows.
Explains the "Inventory Cycle" recession.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Trade in Value Added (TiVA)
Official trade stats are misleading.
US Imports iPhone from China for $500.
Trade Deficit = $500.
But Chinese Value Added (Assembly) is only $10.
Japanese/Korean parts = $200.
US IP = $290 (Profit to Apple).
Real "Deficit" with China is small.
TiVA data corrects this distortion.

### 3.2 Just-in-Time (JIT) Fragility
GVCs optimized for efficiency (Zero inventory).
COVID broke this.
One missing screw from Malaysia stops Ford production in Michigan.
Shift to Just-in-Case ratings.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Intermediary Goods Trade
Global trade is mostly "Intermediate Goods" (Parts), not Final Goods.
If Trade War puts tariffs on Parts.
US Manufacturer costs rise. Competitiveness falls.
Trade War shoots own foot.

### 4.2 The Vietnam Play
Apple moving assembly to Vietnam.
Vietnam captures the "Middle" of the smile curve.
GDP boom, but Value Capture limited unless they develop local tech brands (VinFast?).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Semiconductors):**
Design (Nvidia - US) $\to$ High Value.
Fab (TSMC - Taiwan) $\to$ High Value (Exception to smile curve due to extreme complexity).
Assembly (Foxconn - China) $\to$ Low Value.
Complexity alters the curve.

**Exercise 2 (Logistics):**
Freight Forwarders (Kuehne+Nagel).
They profit from GVC complexity.
De-globalization hurts their volume, but complexity increases their margin?
