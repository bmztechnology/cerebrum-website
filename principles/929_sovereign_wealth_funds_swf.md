# Sovereign Wealth Funds SWF

## I. Executive Summary

**Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)** are state-owned investment vehicles managing trillions in surplus (Oil, Trade). They shift capital from **Hoarding** (Reserves in T-Bills) to **Investing** (Equity/Real Estate). The synthesis focuses on **Geopolitical Capital**—how nations use SWFs (Norway, China, Saudi) to exert **Soft Power** and secure **Strategic Assets** (Tech, Infrastructure).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stabilization vs Savings)
**Stabilization Fund:** Cushions commodity shocks (Russia). Liquid assets. If Oil drops, drawdown fund to balance budget.
**Savings Fund:** Intergenerational wealth transfer (Norway). Long-term assets. "Dutch Disease" prevention (recycling Forex capability outside the domestic economy).

### Definition 2.2 (State Capitalism)
The blurring of Public and Private.
Saudi PIF investing in Uber, Lucid, SoftBank.
State directing innovation via venture capital.
"Leviathan as LP."
Conflict: Political goals (Vision 2030) vs Financial Returns.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Dutch Disease
Large resource discovery (Oil) $\implies$ Currency appreciates $\implies$ Manufacturing dies.
Solution: Sterilize the inflows.
Park the dollars abroad in an SWF.
Keep domestic currency stable.
SWF is a macroeconomic tool, not just a hedge fund.

### 3.2 The Santiago Principles
Voluntary code of conduct for SWFs.
Transparency, Independence, Governance.
Designed to calm Western fears about "Foreign Takeovers."
