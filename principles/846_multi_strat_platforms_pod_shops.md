# Multi Strat Platforms Pod Shops

## I. Executive Summary

**Multi-Strategy Platforms** (Citadel, Millennium, Point72) employ a "Pod" structure. Each Pod (PM + Analysts) acts as a mini-hedge fund with allocated capital and strict **Risk Limits** (Drawdown, Factor Exposure). The Platform provides **Centralized Risk Management**, Infrastructure, and Execution. This industrialization of Alpha focuses on **Sharpe Ratio Maximization** and **Factor Neutrality**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Pass-Through Expense)
LPs pay all expenses (Salaries, Data, Coffee).
No Management Fee? Or "Pass-through" which can be 5-10%.
Plus Incentive Fee (20-30%).
Expensive.
But Returns are Net of Everything.
If Citadel delivers 20% Net with 0 Beta, LPs pay anything.

### Definition 2.2 (Netting Risk)
Pod A Long Apple.
Pod B Short Apple.
Platform Net Position: Flat.
Platform internalizes the trade. No commission paid to street.
"Internal Cross."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Capital Allocation Algorithm
Platform allocates capital to Pods based on trailing Sharpe and Capacity.
Ruthless optimization.
"Cut the losers, feed the winners."
Pod Drawdown limit: Down 5% $\implies$ Capital halved. Down 7% $\implies$ Liquidated (Fired).
Survival of the fittest.

### 3.2 Capacity vs Scale
Pods allow infinite scaling?
Add another sector pod. Add a macro pod.
Diversification of Alphas.
If Correlation(Pod A, Pod B) $\approx$ 0.
Portfolio Volatility decreases as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$.
Allows Platform to leverage up 5-8x.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Data Moat
Platform buys every alternative dataset (Credit cards, Satellite, Email receipts).
Cost: \$100M/year.
Single Manager cannot compete.
Information Asymmetry institutionalized.

### 4.2 Talent War
Bidding wars for PMs.
Sign-on bonuses (\$10M+).
Non-competes.
"Gardening Leave" (Paid to sit on beach for 1 year).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Unwind):**
If Platform faces margin call.
Must liquidate all Pods proportionally.
Correlation goes to 1.
"Quant Quake" (2007).
Crowded trades unwind simultaneously.

**Exercise 2 (Factor Exposure):**
Central Risk Book.
Chief Risk Officer sees Pod A is Long Momentum. Pod B is Long Momentum.
Platform has huge Momentum risk.
CRO creates an overlay hedge (Short Momentum ETF) to neutralize.
