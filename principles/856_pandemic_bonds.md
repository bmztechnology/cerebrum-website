# Pandemic Bonds and Viral Microstructure

## I. Executive Summary

**Pandemic Bonds** (e.g., World Bank PEF) were designed to provide rapid funding for developing nations during outbreaks. They failed spectacularly during COVID-19 due to **Trigger Complexity** (too slow/restrictive). The market for Pandemic Risk has largely frozen, shifting towards **Public-Private Partnerships** and **Parametric Solutions**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (World Bank PEF - Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility)
Class A and B Bonds.
Coupons 6% and 11%.
Trigger conditions:
1. Deaths > X in Country A.
2. Deaths > Y in Country B.
3. Growth Rate > Z.
4. Time duration > 12 weeks.
Critique: "Paid too late." Investors engaged in "ISDA-like" parsing of definition of "Outbreak."

### Definition 2.2 (Viral Correlation)
Pandemic is the ultimate Systemic Risk.
Assets Down. Health Claims Up. Life Claims Up. BI Claims Up.
Correlation = 1.
Capital markets appetite is low because it correlates with the "Global Economy" factor.
Requires "Government Backstop" layer.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The SIR Model in Pricing
Susceptible, Infected, Recovered.
Actuarial models simulate viral spread ($R_0$).
Bond pricing depends on $P(\text{Pandemic})$.
Tail risk is fat.
Fat tails are hard to price.

### 3.2 Moral Hazard
If country holds insurance, do they invest in prevention?
Bond structure funded prevention? No.
Future Structure: "Resilience Bonds." Coupon drops if country invests in hospitals.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Event Cancellation Insurance
Wimbledon.
Bought Pandemic coverage for 17 years (\$1.5M/year).
Payout \$140M in 2020.
"The wisest hedge in history."
Market closed post-2020. Now excluded.

### 4.2 Parametric Viral Triggers
Trigger: WHO Declaration of PHEIC (Public Health Emergency).
Trigger: Excess Mortality statistics.
Trigger: Civil Aviation traffic drop.
Proxies for economic shutdown.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The PEF Default):**
Investors lost 100% of principal (Class B).
Money went to WHO/UN.
Process took months.
Bonds traded at distress prices *during* the outbreak spread.
Microstructure of a dying asset class.

**Exercise 2 (Biosecurity Alpha):**
Hedge Funds trading pharma stocks based on epidemiology?
Yes.
Microstructure effect: Stock prices reacting to "Case Count" data feeds.
