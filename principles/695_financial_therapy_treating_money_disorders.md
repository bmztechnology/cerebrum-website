# Financial Therapy Treating Money Disorders

## I. Executive Summary

**Financial Therapy** is an emerging field combining **Financial Planning** and **Psychotherapy**. It addresses **Money Disorders** (Hoarding, Spending Addiction, Financial Infidelity, Underearning) that stem from trauma or dysfunctional "Money Scripts" formed in childhood. Pure financial advice fails these clients because the issue is emotional, not mathematical.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Money Scripts)
Klontz.
1. **Money Avoidance:** "Money is bad/evil." (Result: Sabotage, Underearning).
2. **Money Worship:** "Money will solve all my problems." (Result: Hoarding, Workaholism).
3. **Money Status:** "Net worth = Self worth." (Result: Overspending, Gambling).
4. **Money Vigilance:** "You must be secretive/frugal." (Result: Anxiety, Cheapness).
Identifying the script is Step 1.

### Definition 2.2 (Financial Infidelity)
Hiding debts/purchases from a spouse.
Like sexual infidelity, it destroys trust.
Root cause: Shame, Fear of conflict, Control dynamics.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Family Systems Theory
Money roles in the family.
"The Responsible One" vs "The Dependent One."
Financial Enabling (giving money to adult children) perpetuates dependency.
Therapy maps the "Genogram" of money flow.

### 3.2 Trauma and Scarcity
Growing up in poverty.
Brain wired for scarcity.
Adult result: Extreme hoarding (fear) OR Binge spending (when money arrives, spend it before it vanishes).
"Poverty PTSD."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Psychology of Debt
Debt = Weight/Shame.
Snowball Method (Pay smallest debt first) vs Avalanche Method (Pay highest interest first).
Math says Avalanche.
Psychology says Snowball (Quick wins needed to sustain motivation).
Therapists recommend Snowball.

### 4.2 Sudden Wealth Syndrome
Lottery winners / Inheritance.
Guilt, Isolation, Paranoia.
Identity crisis.
"I don't deserve this."
Result: Blowing the money to return to the comfort zone of "Normal."
