# Total Return Swaps Credit: Renting the Balance Sheet

## I. Executive Summary

A **Total Return Swap (TRS)** or TRORS allows an investor to receive the **Total Return** (Coupons + Capital Appreciation) of a reference asset (Bond/Loan) in exchange for paying a floating rate (Libor/SOFR) + Spread. The Payer (Bank) holds the asset on its balance sheet; the Receiver (Hedge Fund) gets the economic exposure without funding the purchase.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Legs)
-   **Total Return Leg:** Distributions (Coupons) + Price Appreciation. (If Price drops, Receiver pays depreciation).
-   **Funding Leg:** SOFR + Spread.
-   **Collateral:** Receiver posts margin (e.g., 20%).
Effectively 5x leverage financing.

### Definition 2.2 (Synthetic Ownership)
Receiver has usage of the asset but no voting rights (usually).
However, for Distressed Debt, TRS often includes provisions to direct votes in bankruptcy.
"Hidden Ownership" issues in takeovers (Archegos Capital).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Funding Cost Arb
Hedge Fund borrowing cost: High.
Bank borrowing cost: Low.
Bank buys asset, passes return to HF.
HF pays Bank cost + markup.
Cheaper than HF borrowing cash to buy asset.

### 3.2 Balance Sheet Rental
Bank rents out its balance sheet.
Bank holds risk? Technical legal title, but economic risk transferred to HF via collateral adjustments.
Regulatory risk weighting matters.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shorting Bonds
Hard to borrow corporate bonds (Repo market illiquid).
Enter TRS as "Payer" of Total Return.
Receive Funding.
Synthetic Short.
Bank goes and borrows/shorts the bond to hedge.
Bank has better repo access.

### 4.2 Accessing Restricted Markets
Emerging Market debt with capital controls.
Foreign Investor cannot buy local bond.
Global Bank (with local branch) buys bond.
Writes TRS to Investor abroad.
"Synthetic Access."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Archegos Collapse):**
Used TRS to amass massive Concentrated positions in Viacom/Discovery.
Regulatory disclosure (13F) not required for Swaps (Loophole).
Prime Brokers held the stock.
When Archegos failed margin call, Brokers panic sold simultaneously.
Price crashed 50%.

**Exercise 2 (Dividend Tax Arb):**
TRS used to transfer stock to low-tax jurisdiction around dividend dates.
"Dividend Washing."
Regulators cracking down.
