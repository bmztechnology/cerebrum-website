# Real Estate Assets as Financial Instruments

## I. Executive Summary

**Real Estate** is the largest asset class in the world. It differs from equities due to **Heterogeneity**, **Illiquidity**, and **High Transaction Costs**. However, financialization (REITs, MBS) has transformed it into a tradable instrument. This chapter analyzes Real Estate through the lens of **Capital Markets**, treating buildings as **Bond-Equity Hybrids** with an inflation hedge component.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Four Quadrants)
(Fisher & Zell Model).
1.  **Private Equity:** Direct ownership of buildings.
2.  **Public Equity:** REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
3.  **Private Debt:** Mortgages (Bank loans).
4.  **Public Debt:** MBS / CMBS (Securitized Mortgages).
Arbitrage exists between quadrants (e.g., if REITs trade at discount to NAV, go private).

### Definition 2.2 (Net Operating Income - NOI)
$$ NOI = Rental Income - Operating Expenses $$
Excludes Mortgage Interest and Taxes (Depreciation).
Analogous to EBITDA in corporates.
**Cap Rate ($R$):** $NOI / Price$.
The "Yield" of the building.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Space Market vs The Asset Market
**Space Market:** Usage rights (Rent). Determined by local Supply/Demand (Vacancy). NOI is the output.
**Asset Market:** Ownership rights (Price). Determined by Capital Markets (Interest Rates, Risk Premium). Cap Rate is the output.
Price = NOI / Cap Rate.
A boom can happen if Rents rise (Space shock) OR if Rates fall (Capital shock).

### 3.2 DiPasquale-Wheaton Model
Equilibrium model linking Space Market (Rent) to Asset Market (Price) to Construction Sector (New Supply) to Stock Adjustment (Inventory).
Cycle: High Rent $\to$ High Price $\to$ New Construction $\to$ Oversupply $\to$ Low Rent.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Inflation Hedging
Rents reset (CPI link).
Replacement Cost of building rises with inflation.
Real Estate is a "Real Asset."
Historically correlation with CPI is 0.7+.

### 4.2 Operating Leverage
Fixed Costs are high.
If Occupancy rises 80% $\to$ 90%, NOI rises disproportionately.
Risky in downturns (Vacancy > Breakeven).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Negative Leverage Trap):**
Buy Cap Rate: 5%.
Borrowing Cost: 6%.
Negative Leverage.
ROE < Cap Rate.
Why buy? Banking on Capital Appreciation (Cap Rate compression to 4%).
"Investing for the exit."

**Exercise 2 (Location Alpha):**
Gravity Models in Retail.
Predicting foot traffic.
"Site Selection" as the primary generator of NOI Alpha.
