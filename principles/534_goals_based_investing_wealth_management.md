# Goals Based Investing Wealth Management: Buckets

## I. Executive Summary

**Goals-Based Investing (GBI)** reframes asset allocation not around maximizing Sharpe Ratio, but around **Funding Liabilities** (Goals). It divides wealth into "Buckets" (Mental Accounting), each matched to a specific goal with a distinct Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance. This behavioral framing helps investors stick to the plan by linking volatility to specific outcomes rather than abstract math.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Hierarchy of Needs)
1.  **Safety Bucket (Survival):** Cash/T-Bills. Goal: 6 months expenses. Risk: 0%.
2.  **Market Bucket (Maintained Lifestyle):** Diversified Portfolio (60/40). Goal: Retirement in 20 years. Risk: Market.
3.  **Aspirational Bucket (Get Rich):** Concentrated Bets, Crypto, PE. Goal: Beach House / Philanthropy. Risk: High.
Optimize each bucket separately.

### Definition 2.2 (Probability of Success)
Monte Carlo simulation.
"90% chance of funding Retirement."
"40% chance of funding Beach House."
Manager discusses trade-offs: "To increase Retirement probability to 99%, we must reduce the Beach House allocation."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Behavioral Finance Link
Maslow's Hierarchy.
Loss Aversion is high in Bucket 1 (Survival).
Risk Seeking is high in Bucket 3 (Lottery).
Standard MPT assumes constant Risk Aversion.
GBI accommodates variable risk aversion across wealth tranches.
"Mental Accounting" (Thaler) - usually a bias, utilized here as a tool.

### 3.2 Sub-optimality?
Sum of optimal sub-portfolios $\ne$ Overall optimal portfolio.
We forfeit some diversification (Cash in Bucket 1 isn't netting against Leverage in Bucket 3).
Cost of Behavioral Compliance.
"The best portfolio is the one you can stick with."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Retirement Decumulation
Bucket 1: Cash for Years 1-3.
Bucket 2: Bonds for Years 4-10.
Bucket 3: Stocks for Years 11+.
"Bond Tent" / "Time Segmentation."
Protects against Sequence of Returns risk in the short term while allowing growth for the long term.

### 4.2 Liability Relative Optimization
LDI for individuals.
Discounting the goal: "College Tuition grows at inflation + 5%."
Asset allocation must beat Inflation + 5%.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fungibility):**
Money is fungible.
Crisis hits. Bucket 3 goes to zero.
Client panics.
Advisor reminds: "Bucket 1 is safe. Lifestyle didn't change. Only the Beach House is gone."
Reframing loss.

**Exercise 2 (Inflation):**
Safety Bucket (Cash) is risky in real terms (Inflation).
GBI must account for real vs nominal goals.
