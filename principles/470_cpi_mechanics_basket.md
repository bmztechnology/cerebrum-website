# CPI Mechanics Basket: Methodology

## I. Executive Summary

**CPI-U** (Urban Consumers) is the index used for TIPS. Calculation involves a fixed basket of goods/services. Key components are **Shelter** (33%), **Food**, **Energy**, and **Services**. Methodological nuances like **Owner's Equivalent Rent (OER)** and **Quality Adjustment** (Hedonics) significantly impact the print, creating trading opportunities around the release.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (OER - 24% weight)
Homeowners don't pay rent.
BLS asks: "How much would your house rent for?"
Imputed cost.
Lags real time data (Zillow Index) by 6-12 months.
Source of "Sticky Inflation."

### Definition 2.2 (Geometric Mean)
Lower level substitution.
If Beef price rises, consumers buy Chicken.
Fixed basket (Laspeyres) overstates inflation?
BLS uses Geometric Mean to account for substitution within categories.
Lowers CPI vs "Cost of Goods Index."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Chained CPI (C-CPI-U)
Updates basket weights monthly (instead of biannually).
Accounts for "Upper Level Substitution" (Beef to Tofu).
Usually 0.2% lower than CPI-U.
Used for Tax Brackets (TCJA 2017).
Not used for TIPS (yet).

### 3.2 Hedonics
Quality adjustment.
iPhone 15 costs same as iPhone 14.
But is 20% faster.
Price "dropped" 20% in quality-adjusted terms.
Detractors argue this suppresses reported inflation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Fixing Trade
TIPS indexation is set by the specific CPI release.
Traders predict the decimal (e.g., 0.245%).
Market trades "CPI Fixings" (Swaps on the print).
High gamma event.

### 4.2 Medical Care
Methodology change (Retained Earnings of insurers).
Caused wild swings in 2022.
Understanding BLS idiosyncrasies is alpha.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Seasonality):**
Jan/Feb: New Year price hikes. OER strength.
Summer: Travel/Hotel strength.
Fall: Apparel discounting.
NSA (Non-Seasonally Adjusted) determines TIPS cashflow.
SA (Seasonally Adjusted) drives Fed policy/Headlines.
TIPS traders trade NSA.

**Exercise 2 (Used Cars):**
Small weight (3%) but massive volatility in 2021 (Supply chain).
Drove 1/3 of the inflation spike.
"Transitory" argument.
