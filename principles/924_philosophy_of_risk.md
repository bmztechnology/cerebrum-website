# Philosophy of Risk Uncertainty vs Risk

## I. Executive Summary

**Risk** is when probabilities are known (Roulette). **Uncertainty** (Knightian Uncertainty) is when probabilities are unknown (Pandemic, War). **Philosophy of Risk** explores how to act when the model doesn't exist. The **Precautionary Principle** and **Minimax Regret** replace Optimization. Finance often treats Uncertainty as Risk (Error), leading to **Black Swan** blowups.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Knightian Uncertainty)
Frank Knight (1921).
Risk: "There is a 10% chance of rain." (Insurable).
Uncertainty: "We don't know if it can rain on Mars." (Uninsurable).
Alpha exists in Uncertainty (Entrepreneurship).
Beta exists in Risk.

### Definition 2.2 (The Turkey Illusion)
Bertrand Russell's Inductivist Turkey.
Day 1 to 999: Farmer feeds me. "Farmer loves me." Confidence interval tightens.
Day 1000: Farmer kills me.
The "Black Swan."
Past data confirms the wrong hypothesis.
Knowledge is fragile.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Epistemological humility
We know less than we think.
Models are maps, not territories.
"The map is not the territory" (Korzybski).
Financial crisis occurs when people mistake the Map (AAA Rating) for the Territory (Subprime mortgages).

### 3.2 Maximin Strategy
John Rawls / Wald.
Maximize the minimum outcome.
"Assume the worst case and survive it."
Robustness over Optimality.
Doomsday Prepper portfolio (Gold, Guns, Farmland) is a Maximin strategy against Uncertainty.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Barbell Strategy (Taleb)
90% in T-Bills (Safe from Ruin).
10% in max-risk High Conviction bets (Upside from Uncertainty).
Avoid the "Middle" (Corporate Bonds) where hidden tail risks lie.
Benefit from volatility ("Antifragile").

### 4.2 Scenario Planning
Shell Oil.
Don't predict ONE future.
Plan for MULTIPLE futures (Oil \$20, Oil \$200).
Build a business that survives all.
Resilience.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Nuclear War Risk):**
Probability? Unknown.
Impact: Infinite (Ruin).
Cost of Hedge (Bunker): High.
Pascal's Wager applied to survival.
Is it "Rational" to hedge the end of the world? (If money has no value after?)

**Exercise 2 (The Model Risk Buffer):**
Bank Capital.
Regulator adds a "Buffer" on top of VaR.
Acknowledgment of Knightian Uncertainty.
"We know our model is wrong, so keep extra cash."
