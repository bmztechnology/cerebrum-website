# Reflexivity and Soros

## I. Executive Summary

**Reflexivity** (George Soros) is the feedback loop between **Participants' Views** and the **Actual Situation**. Unlike Physics (where thinking about gravity doesn't change gravity), in Finance, thinking the bank is insolvent *makes* it insolvent. Markets are always wrong (biased), and these biases alter the fundamentals, creating **Boom-Bust Cycles**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Feedback Loop)
Cognitive Function: Understanding the world ($Reality \to View$).
Manipulative Function: Changing the world ($View \to Reality$).
Reflexivity: When both operate simultaneously.
$P_t = f(Bias, Fundamentals)$.
$Fundamentals_{t+1} = g(P_t)$.
Circular causality.

### Definition 2.2 (Disequilibrium)
Standard Economics assumes Equilibrium (Negative Feedback).
Reflexivity assumes Disequilibrium (Positive Feedback).
Price rises $\to$ Collateral increases $\to$ Borrowing increases $\to$ Buying increases $\to$ Price rises.
Self-reinforcing loop until a tipping point.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Conglomerate Boom (1960s)
Company A buys Company B using stock.
Earnings Per Share (EPS) rises (Accounting trick).
Price rises.
Company A can buy Company C even cheaper (using inflated stock).
"The Magic Circle."
Eventually, returns diminish, loop reverses.
Price falls $\to$ Cannot make acquisitions $\to$ EPS growth stops $\to$ Price crashes.

### 3.2 The Superbubble (2008)
Credit + Real Estate + Securitization.
Lending increasing house prices increasing collateral increasing lending.
Regulators believed "Markets are efficient" (False view).
Allowed leverage to explode.
Reflexive collapse when house prices stalled.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Identifying Bubbles
Find the Feedback Loop.
Is the price rise *causing* the fundamental improvement?
(e.g., Crypto project selling tokens to fund development to pump token).
Yes? $\implies$ Reflexive Bubble.
Trade: Ride the trend, but watch the "Inflection Point."

### 4.2 Alchemy of Finance
Soros: "Market prices are always wrong in the sense that they present a biased view of the future."
The goal is not to be "Right" (Fundamental Value).
The goal is to understand the "Prevailing Bias" and bet on it (or against it at the turn).
Trading the Meta-Game.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (British Pound 1992):**
Soros broke the Bank of England.
Bias: "UK can stay in ERM."
Reality: Recession required lower rates.
Reflexivity: High rates caused more recession, making defense harder.
Soros bet huge against the peg.
Self-fulfilling prophecy (The bet itself pressured the peg).

**Exercise 2 (AI Boom):**
Nvidia chips $\to$ Better AI $\to$ More demand for chips.
Reflexive loop?
Or Fundamental shift?
Soros would ask: "Is the valuation affecting the reality?"
Yes, high stock price attracts talent and capital, making success more likely.
