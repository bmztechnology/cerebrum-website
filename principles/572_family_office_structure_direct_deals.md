# Family Office Structure Direct Deals

## I. Executive Summary

**Family Offices** manage the wealth of Ultra-High Net Worth (UHNW) families ($100M+). They operate with extreme **Flexibility**, free from institutional mandates, quarterly reporting, or regulatory constraints (if Single Family Office). The trend is shifting from Fund-of-Funds allocation to **Direct Deals** (buying companies directly), effectively becoming mini-Private Equity firms with "Patient Capital."

**Single Family Office (SFO):** One family. Total control. High cost ($2M+ overhead/year).
**Multi-Family Office (MFO):** Shared resources. Lower cost. Less privacy.
SFOs are the "Smart Money" unregulated whales.

### Definition 2.2 (Patient Capital)

Can hold an asset for 30 years.
Can buy cyclical businesses at the bottom and wait.
