# Voluntary Carbon Markets Verra and Gold Standard

## I. Executive Summary

The **Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)** allows corporations to buy **Offsets** to claim "Net Zero." Unlike Compliance Markets (Cap and Trade), VCM is unregulated and quality varies wildly. Microstructure centers on **Registries** (Verra, Gold Standard) and the crisis of **Baseline Inflation** (overestimating how much carbon was saved).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (REDD+)
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation.
Project: "We promise NOT to cut down this forest."
Credit issuance = (Baseline Deforestation - Actual Deforestation).
Game: Set Baseline artificially high ("We were totally going to burn it all").
Result: "Phantom Credits."

### Definition 2.2 (The Vintage Curve)
Carbon Credits have vintages (Year 2018, 2021).
Old Vintages trade at deep discount (Zombie credits).
New Vintages trade at premium.
Corporates want "Fresh" offsets to match current emissions.
Market segmentation by age.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Additionality
Would the project have happened anyway?
Renewable Energy credits (Solar in India).
Solar is now cheaper than coal. Market forces behave.
Subsidizing it with Carbon Credits fails additionality test.
Registries moving away from Renewables to Removals (DAC).

### 3.2 Permanence
Tree planting (Afforestation).
Tree stores carbon for 40 years.
Then burns in wildfire. Carbon released.
The Credit was used to offset a flight (Permanent emission).
Asymmetry.
"Buffer Pools" (Insurance reserve) used to mitigate reversal risk.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Removal Premium
**Avoidance Credit:** \$2/ton. (Don't cut tree).
**Removal Credit:** \$500/ton. (Direct Air Capture).
Spread is 250x.
Tech companies (Stripe/Meta) buying Removals.
Betting on the quality curve steepening.

### 4.2 Tokenized Carbon
Toucan Protocol.
Bridged millions of zombie credits to blockchain (BCT).
Crypto users swept the floor.
Verra banned bridging.
Regulatory arbitrage closed.
"Garbage on-chain is still garbage."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Guardian Exposé):**
Reporting claimed 90% of Verra rainforest credits were worthless.
Prices crashed.
Shell/Gucci stopped using them.
Demand shock due to reputational toxicity.

**Exercise 2 (Article 6.4):**
Paris Agreement.
UN centralized mechanism to replace VCM?
Sovereign vs Private credits.
Uncertainty freezes investment.
