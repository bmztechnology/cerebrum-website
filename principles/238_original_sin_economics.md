# Original Sin Economics: The Sovereign Curse

## I. Executive Summary

**Original Sin** is a hypothesis (Eichengreen & Hausmann) stating that Emerging Markets (EM) suffer from a structural inability to borrow in their own currency abroad. They must borrow in Hard Currency (USD/EUR). This creates a deadly **Currency Mismatch**: if the local currency depreciates, the real debt burden explodes, leading to inevitable default.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Mismatch)
-   Assets (Tax Revenue): Local Currency (e.g., Pesos).
-   Liabilities (Bond Debt): Foreign Currency (e.g., Dollars).
-   Exchange Rate Shock: Pesos fall 50%.
-   Result: Debt/GDP doubles overnight, even if the government is fiscally responsible.

### Definition 2.2 (Redemption from Sin)
Can countries escape?
Yes. Mexico, Brazil, Poland now issue 80%+ debt in local currency.
Requires:
1.  Floating Exchange Rate.
2.  Inflation Targeting Credibility.
3.  Deep Domestic Pension Funds (to buy the debt).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Fear of Floating
Even if EMs *say* they float, they fear depreciation because of Original Sin.
They use Reserves to defend the currency to prevent debt blowouts.
This creates a hidden "Soft Peg."

### 3.2 Corporate Sin
Even if the Sovereign escapes Sin (borrows in local FX), Corporations typically do not.
Evergrande (China) borrowed billions in USD.
Revenue in Yuan.
Yuan dropped $\to$ Evergrande bankrupt.
Risk migrates from State to Private sector.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Assessing Solvency
Rule: Check the "FX Debt Ratio" (Foreign Currency Debt / Total Debt).
If > 50% $\implies$ High Risk (Turkey, Argentina).
If < 10% $\implies$ Low Risk (Brazil, India).

### 4.2 Trading Reaction
If USD Rallies:
Short "Original Sinners" aggressively.
High correlation between DXY and Sinful Sovereign Credit Spreads (CDS).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Asian Crisis 1997):**
Thailand had massive USD corporate debt.
Baht devalued.
Corporates wiped out. Banks wiped out. Gov forced to socialize debt.
Classic Original Sin crisis.

**Exercise 2 (The Exception):**
USA can borrow in its own currency (USD) forever.
"Exorbitant Privilege" is essentially "Immunity from Original Sin."
