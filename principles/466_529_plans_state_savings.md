# 529 Plans State Savings: Education Wrapper

## I. Executive Summary

**529 Plans** are tax-advantaged savings plans sponsored by States. Assets grow **Tax-Free** and withdrawals are tax-free if used for **Qualified Education Expenses**. While the underlying assets are usually Mutual Funds (Equities/Bonds), the structure is technically a **Municipal Security**. They offer Estate Planning benefits and State Tax deductions.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Wrapper)
"Unit Investment Trust" issuance by the State.
State selects Program Manager (Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock).
Investment Options: Age-Based Portfolios (Target Date), Statiic Portfolios.

### Definition 2.2 (Tax Parity)
Federal Tax Free.
State Tax: usually deductible only if you use *your* state's plan.
"Arizona Loophole": Arizona allows deduction for *any* state's plan? (Check local laws).
Recapture: If non-qualified withdrawal, pay Tax + 10% Penalty.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Prepaid Tuition vs Savings
-   **Prepaid:** Lock in tuition at today's rates. State takes the investment risk (Actuarial liability). Many plans underfunded/closed.
-   **Savings:** Investment account. User takes investment risk. Upside potential.

### 3.2 Municipal Fund Securities
Regulated by MSRB.
Disclosure documents ("Program Description") instead of Prospectus.
Fees: Program Fee + Admin Fee + Fund Expense Ratio.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Superfunding (5-Year Election)

529 allows lumping 5 years at once ($85k).
Remove assets from Estate immediately.
Grow tax free for 18 years.
Grandfather strategy.

### 4.2 K-12 and Roth Rollover
Lists of qualified expenses expanded (TCJA 2017).

SECURE 2.0: Rollover unused 529 funds to Roth IRA (up to \$35k).
Removes the "Overfunding Fear."
