# Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristics

## I. Executive Summary

**Anchoring** is the cognitive bias where an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "Anchor") when making decisions. Subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from the anchor, but the adjustment is typically insufficient. In finance, price targets, entry prices, and "All Time Highs" serve as powerful anchors that distort valuation and price prediction.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Process)
1.  **Anchor Set:** $V_0$ (e.g., Stock was \$100 yesterday).
2.  **New Info:** Earnings bad.
3.  **Adjustment:** $V_{new} = V_0 - \Delta$.
4.  **Bias:** $\Delta$ is too small because $V_0$ exerts gravitational pull.
Result: Under-reaction to news (Post-Earnings Announcement Drift).

### Definition 2.2 (Arbitrary Coherence)
Ariely (2003).
Social Security Number digits anchored willingness to pay for wine.
Random numbers can anchor valuation judgments.
Implication: Listing a house for \$10M makes \$8M seem cheap, even if true value is \$5M.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Price Anchors
**The 52-Week High:**
Traders view stock at \$80 as "Cheap" if 52-week high is \$100.
"20% discount."
If stock falls to \$50, \$80 becomes the new anchor (Resistance).
"Bagholders" anchor on their Break-Even price.

### 3.2 Valuation Multiples
"Historically this trades at 20x P/E."
Anchor: 20x.
If structural growth slows, fair value might be 12x.
Analyst keeps target at 18x (Insufficient adjustment).
Value Traps are often Anchoring Traps.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Negotiation
First offer establishes the anchor.
"I want \$1,000."
Counter-party adjusts down from \$1,000.
Always set the first anchor (if you have context).
If offer is extreme, refuse to negotiate (Destroy the anchor).

### 4.2 Marketing
"Was \$99, Now \$49."
Anchor: \$99.
Perceived Gain: \$50.
Transaction Utility.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Split Effect):**
Stock splits 10-for-1. Price \$1000 $\to$ \$100.
investors anchor on specific dollar figures?
"It's easier for \$100 to go to \$200 than \$1000 to \$2000."
Mathematically false. Psychologically true?

**Exercise 2 (Earnings Guidance):**
Management guides \$1.00 EPS.
Real expectation is \$1.05.
Management sets a low anchor to "Beat and Raise."
The "Expectations Game."
