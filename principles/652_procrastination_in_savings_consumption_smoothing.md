# Procrastination in Savings Consumption Smoothing

## I. Executive Summary

**Procrastination** is the behavioral manifestation of **Hyperbolic Discounting**. In the context of the Life Cycle Hypothesis (Modigliani), individuals should **Smooth Consumption** (Save in youth, Spend in retirement). However, Procrastination ("I'll start saving next year") leads to under-saving and a steep drop in consumption at retirement.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Consumption Function)
$C_t = f(W_t, Y_t)$.
Rational agent spreads windfall $W_t$ over remaining life $T-t$.
Behavioral agent spends $W_t$ immediately (Marginal Propensity to Consume = 1).
Procrastinator delays the *pain* of saving ($C_t < Y_t$) until $t$ is large.

### Definition 2.2 (Exponential Growth Cost)
Delaying saving by 10 years (Age 25 to 35) halves the final retirement pot.
"The Cost of Waiting."
Human brain doesn't grasp $e^{rt}$.
Linear thinking underestimates the cost of procrastination.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Sophisticated vs Naive Procrastinators
**Naive:** "I will do it tomorrow." (Believes they will change). Never does.
**Sophisticated:** "I know I will procrastinate tomorrow." (Self-aware).
Sophisticates use **Commitment Devices** (Deadlines, Penalties).
Naifs are the victims of credit card teasers.

### 3.2 O'Donoghue & Rabin Model
Model of doing it "Now" vs "Later."
Cost is immediate. Benefit is delayed.
With $\beta < 1$, "Later" always looks optimal until the deadline (Retirement) forces action.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Auto-Escalation
"Save More Tomorrow" (SMarT).
Solves procrastination by moving the action to the future.
"I agree to save next year."
Procrastinator is happy to agree to *future* pain.
When future comes, inertia keeps them in the plan.

### 4.2 Gamified Goals
"Streak" of saving.
Visual progress bars.
Immediate reward (digital badge) for the act of saving.
Substitutes the missing Dopamine.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Student Syndrome):**
Waiting until the last night to study.
Retirement: Waiting until age 55 to save.
Panic saving.
Too late for compound interest to work.
Requires high risk taking to catch up.

**Exercise 2 (Financial Education?):**
Does showing a compounding chart cure procrastination?
Rarely.
Emotion (Fear of poverty) or Automation (Force) works better than Math.
