# Algorithmic Central Banking

## I. Executive Summary

Current Central Banking is **Discretionary** (12 humans in a room deciding rates). **Algorithmic Central Banking** proposes replacing the FOMC with a **Rule** (Taylor Rule, Friedman's k-percent rule) or **Code** (Bitcoin Halving, Stablecoin Algo). The synthesis debates **Flexibility vs Credibility**. Humans offer flexibility (Crisis response); Algos offer credibility (No inflation bias).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Rules vs Discretion)
Kydland & Prescott (Nobel).
Discretion leads to "Time Inconsistency."
Central Banker promises low inflation.
Then prints money to boost employment (surprise).
Public learns $\implies$ Expects inflation.
Result: High Inflation, No Employment gain.
Solution: Bind the Banker to a Rule.

### Definition 2.2 (The Taylor Rule)
$i_t = r^* + \pi_t + 0.5(\pi_t - \pi^*) + 0.5(y_t)$.
A simple algo.
If Inflation > Target, Raise Rates > 1:1.
If the Fed followed this code, 2021 Inflation (Transitory error) might have been avoided?
Or would it have caused a Depression?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Bitcoin's Monetary Policy
Input: Time (Block Height).
Output: Supply Issuance (Halving every 210,000 blocks).
Difficulty Adjustment: Keeps time constant.
Perfectly predictable. Zero discretion.
"The Central Bank of Math."
Volatility comes from Demand (since Supply is fixed).

### 3.2 Algorithmic Stablecoins (The Failures)
Terra/Luna.
Algo: "If Price < 1, print Luna to buy Terra."
Death Spiral.
Algos cannot print "Value" out of thin air.
They rely on confidence.
When confidence breaks, the Algo accelerates the crash.
Soros Reflexivity in code.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The DAO Central Bank
MakerDAO.
Token holders vote on "Stability Fees" (Interest Rates).
Decentralized Governance.
Is it an Algo? Or Human Discretion via Tokens?
Moving towards "AI Governance" (Auto-adjusting rates based on on-chain data).

### 4.2 AI in Monetary Policy
Fed using AI to forecast inflation.
Future: AI sets the rate?
"Optimization Objective: Maximize Employment subject to Inflation < 2%."
AI might realize the best way to stop inflation is to crash the economy.
The Alignment Problem in Economics.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Negative Interest Rate Algo):**
Program money to decay 1% per month.
Gesell Money (Freicoin).
Forces high velocity.
Algo enforces what physics cannot.

**Exercise 2 (The Volcker Shock vs The Algo):**
Volcker had the courage to raise rates to 20%.
Would an Algo have the guts?
Or would an Algo have "Stop Loss" logic that prevents it from crushing the economy?
Human resolve vs Machine logic.
