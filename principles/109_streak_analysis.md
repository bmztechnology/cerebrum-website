# Win/Loss Streak Analysis: Pattern Recognition

## I. Win Streak Probability
$$P(n\ wins) = W^n$$

## II. Expected Streaks
Over N trades, expected max streak:
- Win streaks: W^n < 1/N
- Loss streaks: (1-W)^n < 1/N

## III. Psychological Impact
- Overconfidence after wins
- Fear after losses
- Both lead to poor decisions

## IV. Mean Reversion Fallacy
Streaks don't predict next trade.
Each trade is independent.

## V. Practical Application
- Don't increase size after wins
- Don't chase losses
- Maintain consistent sizing

## VI. Statistical Reality
With 60% win rate over 100 trades:
- Expect ~5 consecutive wins
- Expect ~4 consecutive losses
