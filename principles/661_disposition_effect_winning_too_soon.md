# Disposition Effect Winning Too Soon

## I. Executive Summary

The **Disposition Effect** (Shefrin & Statman, 1985) is the robust tendency for investors to **Sell Winners too early** and **Hold Losers too long**. It is driven by **Prospect Theory** (Risk averse in gains, risk seeking in losses) and **Regret Avoidance** (Realizing a loss proves you were wrong; holding keeps hope alive). It is the single most destructive habit for retail performance.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (PGR and PLR)
Odean (1998).
**PGR (Proportion of Gains Realized):** $\frac{\text{Realized Gains}}{\text{Realized Gains} + \text{Paper Gains}}$.
**PLR (Proportion of Losses Realized):** $\frac{\text{Realized Losses}}{\text{Realized Losses} + \text{Paper Losses}}$.
Finding: $PGR \gg PLR$ (Typically 1.5x).
Investors are eager to cash in gains (Lock it in) and reluctant to book losses.

### Definition 2.2 (The Anomaly)
Winners sold go on to outperform Losers held.
Excess return of sold winners over held losers $\approx 3.4\%$ per year.
The behavior is costly.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Mean Reversion Belief
Investors mistakenly believe "What goes up must come down" (Gambler's Fallacy).
So they sell winners.
But stock prices follow momentum.
They sell the trend.

### 3.2 Ego Defense
Realizing a gain validates the ego ("I am smart").
Realizing a loss damages the ego ("I am stupid").
Deferring the loss acts as an ego-shield.
"It's not a loss until I sell." (The ultimate fallacy).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Trailing Stop
Technology cures behavior.
Automated trailing stop explicitly forces holding winners (as long as they go up) and cutting losers.
Removes the decision from the shaky hand.

### 4.2 Tax Loss Harvesting
The Rational opposite of Disposition Effect.
You should Sell Losers (Tax asset) and Hold Winners (Tax liability deferral).
Robo-advisors automate this regular rationality.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The "Free Ride"):**
"Selling half to cover the cost basis."
Psychological trick.
Makes the remaining position feel "Free" (House Money).
Allows the investor to hold the winner for the long run without fear.
Sub-optimal but behaviorally effective.

**Exercise 2 (Audit):**
Download 1 year of trades.
Calculate Average Win vs Average Loss.
If Win < Loss, you have Disposition Effect (or a bad strategy).
Winners must pay for the losers.
