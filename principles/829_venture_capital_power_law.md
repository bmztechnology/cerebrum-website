# Venture Capital Power Law Dynamics

## I. Executive Summary

**Venture Capital (VC)** follows a **Power Law** distribution where 1 fund returner (100x) pays for 99 failures. Unlike Normal Distribution finance (Stock picking), VC is about **Access** to the outliers and **Portfolio Construction** that ensures exposure to the "fat tail." Microstructure involves **Term Sheets** (Liquidation Prefs), **Pro-Rata Rights**, and **Valuation mark-ups**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Power Law)
$$ P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha} $$
Returns are dominated by the single best investment.
Strategy: "Spray and Pray" (Index) vs "Conviction" (Concentration).
To catch the Power Law, you must be in the deal.
You cannot "Model" the Power Law; you must "Option" it.

### Definition 2.2 (Liquidation Preference)
Term Sheet clause. "1x Non-Participating Preference."
If Exit < Invested Capital, VCs get money back first.
If Exit is huge, VCs convert to Common Stock.
Downside protection for VCs, upside alignment.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Stage Financing
Seed $\to$ Series A $\to$ Series B.
Real Options approach.
VC buys a Call Option at Seed level.
Series A is the cost to exercise and extend the option.
Abandonment option: Stop funding if metrics fail.

### 3.2 The Lemons Problem in Secondaries
If a VC wants to sell shares in a startup before IPO.
Buyer asks: "Why are you selling?"
Adverse Selection.
"If it was a Unicorn, they would hold."
VCs only sell their losers? (Or need liquidity).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Pro-Rata Rights
The right to maintain ownership % in future rounds.
Crucial for Power Law.
If you find Uber at Seed, you MUST double down at Series A, B, C.
Dilution kills returns if you don't follow on.

### 4.2 The Markup Game
VC Fund 1 invests at \$10M val.
VC Fund 2 (Friendly) invests at \$50M val.
Fund 1 marks up holding 5x.
Shows high IRR to LPs. Raises Fund 2.
"Paper Gains" vs "DPI" (Distributed to Paid-In).
Tech bubble 2021 was driven by circular markups.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Down Round):**
Valuation drops.
Anti-dilution clauses kick in (Full Ratchet).
Founders get washed out.
Staff options go underwater $\to$ Brain drain.
Death spiral.

**Exercise 2 (Solo GP vs Platform):**
Solo Capitalists (Elad Gil). Speed/Agility. Move fast.
Platforms (a16z). Services (Recruiting/Marketing). High fees.
Microstructure competition for allocation.
