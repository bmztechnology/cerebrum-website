# Eurodollar System: The Shadow Money

## I. Executive Summary

A **Eurodollar** is simply a US Dollar deposit held in a bank outside the United States. It is unregulated by the Federal Reserve (No reserve requirements, no FDIC). This offshore system creates money through credit expansion unchecked by the Fed. It is the true lubricant of Global Trade, and when it dries up, the world experiences a "Dollar Shortage."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Location)
"Euro-" prefix means "Offshore."
Euro-Yen = Yen outside Japan.
Euro-Dollar = Dollar outside US (e.g., in London, Singapore, Cayman).
Not to be confused with the "Euro" currency (€).

### Definition 2.2 (Eurodollar Creation)
Russian bank Deposits Dollars in London Bank.
London Bank lends Dollars to Brazilian Corp.
Money Supply expanded.
Fed has zero visibility or control.
Estimated size: > $13 Trillion (Larger than domestic M2?). No one knows exactly.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Dollar Smile
When Global Growth is strong $\to$ Borrow Eurodollars to invest (Dollar sells off).
When Global Crisis hits $\to$ Repay Eurodollar debt (Scramble for Dollars).
Result: USD rises in a crash.
The Eurodollar Short Squeeze.

### 3.2 LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)
The price of Eurodollars.
Now replaced by SOFR (Domestic Repo).
The transition kills the "Credit Sensitivity" signal.
Eurodollars relied on "Trust" between banks.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 DXY Prediction
DXY is heavily influenced by the Eurodollar funding stress.
If "Cross Currency Basis" is negative (Dollar shortage), DXY will rally even if US Data is bad.
The world *needs* dollars to service $13T of debt.

### 4.2 Emerging Markets (EM)
EM Corps borrow in Eurodollars (lower rates).
Earn revenue in Local Currency (BRL, TRY).
If USD rises, Debt increases, Revenue (in USD terms) falls.
"Original Sin."
Short EM Equities when US Dollar strengthens.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Squeeze):**
2008 Crisis.
Eurodollar market froze. Banks stopped lending.
European banks needed dollars to roll over bad US Mortgage debt.
Fed had to open "Swap Lines" (Lend Dollars to ECB) to save the offshore system.

**Exercise 2 (Exorbitant Privilege):**
US prints paper. World gives goods (Oil, Cars).
Because the world needs Eurodollars for trade (Invoice currency).
If Eurodollar system dies (Dedollarization), US standard of living collapses.
