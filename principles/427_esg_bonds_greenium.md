# ESG Bonds Greenium: Sustainability

## I. Executive Summary

**ESG Bonds** integrate Environmental, Social, and Governance goals into fixed income. **Green Bonds** ("Use of Proceeds") fund specific green projects. **Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs)** ("General Corporate Purposes") penalize the issuer with a **Step-Up Coupon** (e.g., +25bps) if KPI targets (Carbon reduction) are missed. The **Greenium** is the yield discount investors accept for holding green assets.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Greenium)
$Yield_{green} - Yield_{brown} < 0$.
Typically 2-5 basis points.
Caused by excess demand from ESG mandates vs limited supply.
Allows issuers to borrow cheaper.

### Definition 2.2 (SLB Structure)
Bond issued at 4%.
KPI: Reduce CO2 by 50% by 2030.
Observation Date: 2030.
If Missed: Coupon steps up to 4.25% for remaining life.
Financial incentive to decarbonize.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Paradox of SLBs
If company fails KPI (Bad for planet), Investor gets higher yield (Good for PnL).
"Perverse Incentive."
However, credit quality likely deteriorates if targets missed (Transition Risk).
Step-up compensates for the increased credit risk.

### 3.2 Greenwashing
"Use of Proceeds": Efficient lighting in headquarters?
Lack of standardization (ICMA Principles are voluntary).
EU Green Bond Standard (EuGBS) aims to enforce taxonomy.
Reputational risk for issuers.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Capital Cost Advantage
Utilities issuing Green Bonds to fund wind farms.
Cheaper capital $\implies$ Higher ROE on project.
Virtuous cycle.

### 4.2 Portfolio Decoration
Fund Managers buy Green Bonds to improve "Weighted Average Carbon Intensity" (WACI) of portfolio.
Reporting requirements (SFDR Art 9).
Drive demand regardless of price.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Liquidity):**
Green bonds often held to maturity by ESG funds.
Lower float. Less liquidity.
Should require *higher* illiquidity premium?
Greenium overrides liquidity premium.

**Exercise 2 (Stripping the Green):**
Can you strip the "Green-ness"?
No. It's tied to the CUSIP.
But "Green Derivatives" (Green CDS) are emerging to hedge ESG risk specifically.
