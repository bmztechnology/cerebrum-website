# Cornering and Abusive Squeezes

## I. Executive Summary

**Cornering the Market** is securing control of the supply of a commodity or security to force **Short Sellers** to pay exorbitant prices to cover. While natural **Short Squeezes** occur (high demand > supply), a **Corner** is an intentional, manipulative monopolization. Modern variants include **Gamma Squeezes** where options dealers are forced to buy, creating a feedback loop.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Corner)
Requires:
1. Long Position > Available Float.
2. Demand for delivery (Futures contract expiry).
Shorts *must* deliver.
Long refuses to lend or sell except at Price $\infty$.
Silver Thursday (Hunt Brothers, 1980).
Porsche / Volkswagen (2008).

### Definition 2.2 (Gamma Squeeze)
Retail buys OTM Calls.
Dealers (Short Calls) must Delta Hedge.
Delta rises as Price rises.
Dealers must Buy Stock to hedge.
Buying Stock $\implies$ Price Rises $\implies$ Delta Rises $\implies$ Buy More.
Weaponized Convexity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Prisoner's Dilemma for Shorts
If Shorts coordinate, they might survive.
But if one Short covers, Price rises, hurting others.
Dominant Strategy: Cover First.
Panic buying.
The "Stampede."

### 3.2 Regulatory Limits
Position Limits (CFTC).
"No one can own > X contracts."
Designed to prevent Corners.
Volkswagen maneuver: Owned 74% via Options (Hidden). Government owned 20%. Float was 6%. Short Interest was 12%.
Math: 12% needed, 6% available.
Price $\to \infty$.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Locates and Reg SHO
"Naked Shorting" (Shorting without borrowing) is illegal.
broker must "Locate" shares.
In a squeeze, Locates dry up. Cost to Borrow (CTB) hits 100%+.
Shorts forced to close by broker (Force Buy-in).

### 4.2 The Infinity Pool
Retail theory (GME/AMC).
"If we own the float and don't sell, price goes to infinity."
Problem: Regulators intervene.
Exchanges halt trading.
Rules change (Margin requirements raised to 100%).
Structure prevents true infinity.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Hunt Silver):**
Bought physical silver + futures.
Price 6 $\to$ 50.
Exchange changed rules: "Liquidation Only."
Hunts couldn't buy. Price crashed.
Corner failed due to rule change.

**Exercise 2 (Negative Oil):**
April 2020.
Storage Full.
Longs (USO) couldn't take delivery.
Shorts didn't need to cover? No, Longs *had* to sell.
Reverse Corner? "Squeeze to the downside."
