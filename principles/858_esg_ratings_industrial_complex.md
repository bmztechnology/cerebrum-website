# ESG Ratings The Rater Industrial Complex

## I. Executive Summary

**ESG Ratings** (MSCI, Sustainalytics) attempt to quantify non-financial risks (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance). The microstructure is plagued by **low correlation** between raters (0.3 vs 0.99 for Credit Ratings), creating **Rating Arbitrage**. The industry has shifted from "Values-based" (Ethical) to "Value-based" (Materiality) assessment, driving trillions in **Passive Flows**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Double Materiality)
**Financial Materiality (SASB):** How does climate change affect the *company's* bottom line? (Single Materiality).
**Impact Materiality (GRI):** How does the *company* affect the climate?
US Investors focus on Financial Materiality. EU Investors focus on Double Materiality.
Conflict in ratings methodology.

### Definition 2.2 (The Methodology Black Box)
MSCI Weighting: 20% Carbon, 20% Labor, 60% Governance?
Adjustments for "Industry Neutrality."
A "Best-in-Class" Oil company can have a higher rating (AA) than a "Worst-in-Class" Tech company?
Relative vs Absolute scoring confuses retail investors.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Aggregate Confusion
Aggregate Score obscures detail.
Company A: Good Environment, Bad Governance. Score 50.
Company B: Bad Environment, Good Governance. Score 50.
Portfolio Manager buys both.
Net result: Portfolio risks are not managed.
Signal noise.

### 3.2 Imputation and Estimation
Small caps don't report data.
Raters fill gaps with "Machine Learning Estimates" (Imputation).
Estimated data is often wrong.
" Garbage In, Garbage Out" in the index construction.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Rating Upgrades
Buy stock *before* MSCI upgrade.
Passive ETFs (ESGU) force buy.
Momentum trade.
Managers hire consultants to "Game the Rating" (Disclose more policies, even if action is zero).
"Box Ticking" Alpha.

### 4.2 The Divergence Trade
Long stocks where Sustainalytics > MSCI.
Short stocks where MSCI > Sustainalytics.
Betting on convergence?
Or betting that the market favors one provider's methodology (MSCI dominance).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tesla's Exclusion):**
S&P 500 ESG Index kicked out Tesla. Kept Exxon.
Reason: Governance (Elon) and Safety factors.
Outrage: "How is the EV leader bad for E?"
Demonstrates the "S" and "G" dominance in the weighting.

**Exercise 2 (Greenwashing Litigation):**
DWS (Deutsche Bank) raided for "Greenwashing."
Market reaction: Outflows.
Legal risk sets a floor on how much "Marketing Spin" is allowed.
