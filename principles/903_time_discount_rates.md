# Time Discount Rates vs Hyperbolic Discounting

## I. Executive Summary

**Time** is the X-axis of finance. The Standard Model assumes **Exponential Discounting** (constant discount rate over time). Reality is **Hyperbolic Discounting** (we prefer \$100 today over \$110 tomorrow, but don't care about \$100 in 10 years vs \$110 in 10 years + 1 day). This mismatch creates **Term Structure Anomalies** and Short-Termism in corporate strategy.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Exponential Discounting)
$$ PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^t} $$
If $r=5\%$, the discount factor decays smoothly.
Consistency: If I prefer A over B today, I will prefer A over B in 10 years.
Rational intertemporal choice.

### Definition 2.2 (Hyperbolic Discounting)
$$ PV = \frac{FV}{1 + kt} $$
Discount rate is higher in the short term, lower in the long term.
"Present Bias."
Explains why CEOs pump earnings for this quarter (High discount rate) even if it destroys value in Year 10 (Low discount rate).
Markets overvalue the immediate.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Duration Paradox
Growth Stocks (Tech) have High Duration (Cash flows far in future).
Value Stocks (Banks) have Low Duration (Cash flows now).
When Rates Rise: High Duration falls more.
But Hyperbolic Discounting suggests we *should* discount the distant future heavily anyway?
Why do we pay 100x PE for Tech?
Because we hallucinate the distant future as "Risk Free."

### 3.2 Negative Discount Rates
Japan / Eurozone (2015-2020).
Paying the government to hold your money.
Time value of money flip.
Implies the future is *worse* than the present (Deflation/Doom).
Finance math breaks when $r < 0$.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Exploiting Short-Termism
CEOs cut R&D to hit quarterly EPS.
Market rewards them (Stock pops).
Strategy: Short companies with declining R&D intensity but rising EPS.
They are eating their seed corn.
Long-term convergence to zero.

### 4.2 The 100-Year Bond
Austria / Mexico issued 100-year bonds.
Sensitivity (Convexity) is massive.
Rates rise 1% $\implies$ Price drops 50%.
Trading "Time" as a pure factor.
The ultimate Duration bet.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Climate Change Discounting):**
Cost of Climate Change in 2100: \$50 Trillion.
Discounted at 5%: $PV = \$50T / (1.05)^{75} \approx \$1.2T$.
We should spend \$1.2T today to fix it.
Discounted at 1% (Social Discount Rate): PV is massive.
The Discount Rate determines the morality of the policy.

**Exercise 2 (Marshmallow Test):**
Delayed gratification.
High correlation with trading success.
The ability to hold a winner (Exponential) vs selling too soon for dopamine (Hyperbolic).
