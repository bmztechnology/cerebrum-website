# Dual Process Theory System 1 and 2

## I. Executive Summary

**Dual Process Theory** (Kahneman) models the brain as two systems. **System 1** is fast, intuitive, emotional, and heuristic-prone (The Trader's Gut). **System 2** is slow, analytical, logical, and lazy (The Trader's Spreadsheet). Successful trading requires **Metacognition**: knowing when to trust System 1 (in familiar situations) and when to engage System 2 (in novel/complex situations).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (System 1)
Characteristics: Automatic, Effortless, Associative, Fast.
Errors: Biases (Confirmation, Availability).
Strengths: Pattern recognition (Tape reading).
"The Elephant" (Haidt).

### Definition 2.2 (System 2)
Characteristics: Controlled, Effortful, Deductive, Slow.
Errors: Fatigue, Analysis Paralysis.
Strengths: Math, Statistics, Verification.
"The Rider" (Haidt).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Cognitive Load
System 2 requires glucose and focus.
Under stress (Market Crash), System 2 shuts down.
Traders revert to System 1 (Panic selling).
"Choking" is the failure of System 2 under pressure? Or the intrusion of System 2 into automatic System 1 skills?

### 3.2 Expert Intuition
Is System 1 bad?
No. Firefighter sensing danger.
Experienced trader sensing a trap.
"Recognition Primed Decision Making" (Klein).
Requires valid environment + 10,000 hours of feedback.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Circuit Breakers
Forcing System 2 engagement.
Trading Journal.
"Write down why you are doing this."
Stops the impulse (System 1).

### 4.2 Algorithmic Trading
Outsourcing to System 2 (Code).
Code is "Frozen System 2."
It executes without System 1 interference.
The ultimate solution to Dual Process conflict.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Bat and Ball):**
Bat + Ball = \$1.10. Bat costs \$1.00 more than ball. Cost of ball?
System 1: \$0.10. (Wrong).
System 2: $x + (x+1) = 1.10 \implies 2x = 0.10 \implies x = 0.05$. (Right).
Markets are full of Bat and Ball problems (e.g., Yield vs Price).

**Exercise 2 (The Pre-Mortem):**
Before trade, engage System 2: "Imagine it is 6 months later and the trade failed. Why?"
Forces analytical check on optimism.
