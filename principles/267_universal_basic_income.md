# Universal Basic Income: The Helicopter Drop

## I. Executive Summary

**Universal Basic Income (UBI)** is a guaranteed cash payment to all citizens, regardless of need or work status. Proposed as a solution to **Automation displacement** and the "Poverty Trap" of means-tested welfare. Critics argue it causes Inflation and destroys the incentive to work. Experiments (Finland, Kenya) show mixed results: improved health/education, minimal work reduction, but high fiscal cost.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Negative Income Tax - Friedman)
Similar to UBI.
Threshold: $30,000.
If you earn $0, Gov pays you $15,000 (50% subsidy).
If you earn $30,000, Tax is 0.
If you earn $100,000, you pay tax.
Smoothes the transition. Eliminates the "Welfare Cliff."

### Definition 2.2 (The Funding Math)
US UBI: $1000/month $\times$ 330M people $\approx$ $4 Trillion/year.
US Federal Budget $\approx$ $6 Trillion.
Requires doubling taxes or replacing ALL other welfare (Social Security, Medicare, Food Stamps).
Political suicide to cut Medicare.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Velocity of Money
Checks to the poor (High MPC).
Velocity explodes.
Inflationary?
Depends on Supply Chain capacity.
Stimulus Checks 2020 were a "Mini-UBI."
Result: 9% Inflation.
Proved the Inflationary Thesis? Or was it Supply collapse?

### 3.2 Bargaining Power
UBI gives workers a "BATNA" (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement).
"F*ck You Money."
Workers can refuse dangerous/underpaid jobs.
Wages for bad jobs must rise.
De-commodification of labor.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Automation Tax Link
UBI Funded by Tax on Robots.
If AI takes all jobs, GDP is high but Wages are 0.
Mechanism to recirculate profits to consumers so they can buy the AI's products.
Circular flow necessity.

### 4.2 Crypto UBI (Worldcoin)
Sam Altman project.
Scan Iris (Proof of Personhood). Receive Token.
Private sector UBI?
Monetary policy by Tech Bros.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Alaska Permanent Fund):**
Dividend from Oil Wealth paid to every Alaskan ($1000-$3000/yr).
Popular. Politics turned into "Protect the Dividend."
Resource UBI works.

**Exercise 2 (Inflation Hedge):**
If UBI is printed (not taxed).
Currency debasement is guaranteed.
UBI is the roadmap to Hyperinflation if not sterilised.
