# Neurofinance Dopamine Reward Prediction

## I. Executive Summary

**Neurofinance** uses neuroscience (fMRI scans, hormone levels) to understand financial decision making. The core finding is that trading activates the same reward pathways as **Cocaine** and **Gambling** (Nucleus Accumbens). **Dopamine** is released not upon reward, but upon the **Prediction of Reward**. This drives addictive trading behavior and explains why "The anticipation is better than the event" (Buy the Rumor, Sell the News).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Reward Prediction Error - RPE)
$$ RPE = Reward_{actual} - Reward_{expected} $$
$RPE > 0$: Dopamine spike (Euphoria). Learning occurs (Reinforcement).
$RPE < 0$: Dopamine dip (Dysphoria). Learning occurs (Avoidance).
$RPE = 0$: No dopamine.
Traders get addicted to the *variance* (Positive RPE surprises).

### Definition 2.2 (Cortisol and Risk)
Coates (2008).
Stress releases Cortisol.
Chronic Cortisol creates "Learned Helplessness" and risk aversion.
Traders in a drawdown become biologically incapable of taking rational risk.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Winner's Effect
Testosterone.
Winning trade $\implies$ Testosterone spike.
Increases confidence and risk tolerance.
Positive feedback loop $\implies$ Overtrading $\implies$ Blow up.
"Biological exuberance."

### 3.2 Somatic Marker Hypothesis
Damasio.
We "feel" a trade is bad before we calculate it.
Gut feeling = Interoception (Body signals).
Successful traders interpret these signals better than novices.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Detox
Dopamine fasting?
Removing the "Gamification" (flashing lights, PnL tickers).
Trading from a spreadsheet / API to remove emotional stimulus.

### 4.2 The Noon Lull
Circadian rhythms affecting liquidity.
Cortisol is highest in morning (Open).
Cognitive fatigue in afternoon.
Algos exploit human biological weakness.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Delaying Gratification):**
Marshmallow Test.
Impatience (High discount rate) correlates with lower wealth.
Trading strategy: Long term holding requires suppressing the dopamine urge for a quick flip.

**Exercise 2 (Loss Chasing):**
Loss $\to$ Dopamine Deficit.
Brain craves restoration.
Risky bet offers chance of huge Dopamine spike.
Biologically driven gambling.
