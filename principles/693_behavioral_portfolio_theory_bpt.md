# Behavioral Portfolio Theory BPT

## I. Executive Summary

**Behavioral Portfolio Theory (BPT)** (Shefrin & Statman, 2000) contrasts with Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). While MPT sees investors as viewing the portfolio as a **whole** (Mean-Variance frontier), BPT sees investors constructing portfolios as layers of a **Pyramid**. Each layer corresponds to a specific **Goal** (Safety, Retirement, Get Rich) and uses a specific **Mental Account**. The portfolio is not optimized for correlation, but for **Goal Satisfaction**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Pyramidal Portfolio)
**Layer 1 (Bottom):** Safety. "Don't be poor." Assets: Cash, Treasuries, Insurance. (Risk Averse).
**Layer 2 (Middle):** Lifestyle. "Retirement." Assets: Index Funds, Blue Chips. (Risk Neutral).
**Layer 3 (Top):** Aspirations. "Get Rich." Assets: Options, Crypto, Lottery Tickets. (Risk Seeking).
The aggregate portfolio lies *below* the Efficient Frontier, but fits the psychology.

### Definition 2.2 (Safety First)
Roy / Telser.
Constraint: $Prob(Wealth < Subsistence) \le \alpha$.
Maximize $E[W]$ subject to constraint.
Explains why people hold Cash (0 return) and Moonshots (High risk) simultaneously (Barbell Strategy).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Mental Accounting Integration
Assets in Layer 1 are *never* touched for Layer 3 risks.
Covariance is ignored.
"I don't care if my Crypto hedges my Bonds. My Bonds are for eating."
Separation hinders mathematical efficiency but provides emotional robustness.

### 3.2 Threshold Utility
Utility is step-function based on goals.
Reaching \$1M (Retirement) provides massive utility jump.
Falling below \$50k (Poverty) is disaster.
Between \$50k and \$1M, utility is linear.
Goal-based investing optimizes for hitting the thresholds (Prob of Success) rather than Sharpe Ratio.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Product Design
Structured Products.
"Principal Protection + 80% of Upside."
Perfectly targets BPT.
Principal Protection satisfies Layer 1.
Upside satisfies Layer 3.
Fees are hidden in the middle, but the client is happy.

### 4.2 Robo-Advisors
"Goal Based Investing."
Bucket 1: "House." Bucket 2: "Kids."
Allocating different risk profiles to each bucket.
Technically inefficient (money is fungible), but behaviorally compliant.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Lottery Ticket):**
Why do poor people buy lottery tickets?
They are effectively "Long Volatility" in Layer 3.
It is the only chance to change social class.
Rational within the context of Aspirational utility.

**Exercise 2 (Insurance):**
Why buy insurance (Negative EV)?
Layer 1 protection.
We pay premium to remove the left tail.
