# Crawling Pegs: The Managed Float

## I. Executive Summary

A **Crawling Peg** is an exchange rate regime where the currency is allowed to fluctuate within a band that is periodically adjusted (crawls) to account for inflation differentials. It is a hybrid between a Fixed Peg and a Free Float. **Singapore (MAS)** uses a sophisticated basket-based crawling peg (NEER) to target inflation rather than interest rates.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Purchasing Power Parity Crawl)
Rate of Crawl $\approx \pi_{domestic} - \pi_{foreign}$.
If Domestic Inflation is 10% and Foreign is 2%, the Peg must devalue by 8% per year to maintain real competitiveness.
Prevents the currency from becoming overvalued.

### Definition 2.2 (The Singapore Band)
MAS targets **S$NEER** (Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate).
-   **Slope:** The rate of appreciation (during inflation).
-   **Width:** The volatility allowed.
-   **Center:** The reference point.
MAS acts by buying/selling SGD to keep it inside the invisible band.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Exchange Rate Centered Monetary Policy
For small open trade-dependent economies (Singapore > 300% Trade/GDP).
Exchange Rate affects inflation MORE than Interest Rates do.
Stronger SGD $\implies$ Cheaper Imports $\implies$ Lower Inflation.
MAS appreciates the currency to fight inflation.

### 3.2 Diagonal Bands
Visualizing the chart.
Instead of horizontal support/resistance.
The "Support" is a rising trendline (Slope).
Breaking the trendline triggers intervention.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Secret Baskets
MAS does not reveal the weights of the basket (likely USD, CNY, MYR, EUR).
Quants use regression analysis to reverse-engineer the weights.
"SGD Proxy Model."
Trade: Long SGD / Short Weighted Basket.

### 4.2 Breaking the Crawl
If inflation spirals, Central Bank might "Re-center" the band upwards (One-off appreciation).
Event Risk.
Happens usually at scheduled policy meetings (April/October for MAS).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Vietnam):**
Uses a crawling peg against USD.
Devalues 2-3% per year steadily.
Keeps exports competitive.
Predictable devaluation encourages FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) because factory owners know the future rate.

**Exercise 2 (Turkey):**
Tried a crawling peg.
Market attacked it.
Ran out of reserves.
Shifted to Free Float (Crash).
Crawling Pegs require reserves to defend the edges.
