# Reflexivity Soros Theory

## I. Executive Summary

**Reflexivity** (George Soros) is the theory that **Perception** changes **Reality**, which in turn changes Perception. Unlike physical systems (Planets don't care what we think), social systems have a **Foundational Uncertainty**. Market prices are not passive reflections of value; they act as active agents that can create or destroy value (e.g., High stock price allows cheap financing $\implies$ Company survives $\implies$ Stock legitimate).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cognitive Function vs Manipulative Function)
**Cognitive:** Trying to understand the world ($World \to Mind$).
**Manipulative:** Trying to change the world ($Mind \to World$).
In markets, these interfere.
"I buy because I accept the view (Cognitive), but my buying pushes price up (Manipulative)."

### Definition 2.2 (Boom-Bust Feedback Loop)
Positive Feedback:
Price $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Collateral $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Credit $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Demand $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Price $\uparrow$.
The "Fundamental" is changed by the Price.
Shattering:
Price $\downarrow$ $\implies$ Margin Call $\implies$ Liquidation $\implies$ Price $\downarrow$.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The REITS Example
Real Estate Investment Trusts.
1. Yield is high. Stock rises.
2. High stock allows Equity Offering at premium.
3. Cheap capital allows buying more buildings, increasing EPS.
4. Higher EPS $\implies$ Higher Stock.
5. Loop continues until saturation.
6. Fundamentals were *created* by the high stock price.

### 3.2 Fallibility
"I am always wrong."
Recognizing that all market theories are flawed.
The flaw in the thinking IS the source of the boom.
Identifying the "Prevailing Bias" (The lie the market believes).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the Bias
Step 1: Identify the Trend.
Step 2: Identify the Bias (the misconception fueling it).
Step 3: Ride the trend as bias reinforces reality.
Step 4: Exit when reality can no longer sustain the bias (Inflection Point).

### 4.2 Quantum Fund Strategy
Betting on "Disequilibrium."
Soros shorting the GBP (1992).
The ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism) was a rigid structure incompatible with economic reality.
Reflexivity suggested the Bank of England's defense would *accelerate* the collapse (Higher rates $\implies$ Recession $\implies$ weaker currency).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tech Bubble 2000):**
Price $\uparrow$ $\implies$ VC Funding $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Startup Revenue (Selling to other startups) $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Price $\uparrow$.
Circular economy.
Reflexive collapse.

**Exercise 2 (Regulation):**
Regulators observe the market to set rules.
Market observes regulators to set prices.
Feedback loop between Wall St and Washington.
