# Minsky Moment Theory: Stability Breeds Instability

## I. Executive Summary

**Hyman Minsky** argued that the financial system is inherently unstable. Long periods of stability induce complacency, leading to excessive risk-taking and leverage. The "Minsky Moment" is the tipping point where Ponzi borrowers default, triggering a collapse of asset values and a rush for liquidity. This counters the "Efficient Market Hypothesis" which assumes equilibrium.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Three Types of Borrowers)
1.  **Hedge Finance:** Income > Principle + Interest. (Safe).
2.  **Speculative Finance:** Income > Interest. (Refinancing Principle is required).
3.  **Ponzi Finance:** Income < Interest. (Must borrow MORE just to pay interest. Relies on Asset Appreciation).
As the cycle matures, the economy shifts from Hedge $\to$ Speculative $\to$ Ponzi.

### Definition 2.2 (The Moment)
When asset prices stop rising.
Ponzi borrowers cannot refinance. They must sell assets.
Selling drives down prices.
Speculative borrowers become Ponzi borrowers.
Cascade.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Recent Minsky Moments
-   **2008 Subprime:** House prices stopped rising. HELOCs (Ponzi) blew up.
-   **2022 Crypto:** LUNA/Terra. Algorithms relied on token appreciation to pay 20% yield. Price drop = Death Spiral.

### 3.2 The Paradox of Volatility
Low Volatility encourages Leverage (VaR models say it's safe).
High Leverage creates hidden fragility.
Therefore, "The Great Moderation" (Low Vol) causes "The Great Crash."
Central Bank Puts (suppressing Vol) create future crashes.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Identifying Ponzi Sectors
Look for:
1.  Exponential Price Growth.
2.  Cash Flow Negative entities.
3.  Narrative: "It's different this time" (New Paradigm).
4.  Private Credit boom.
Current candidate: Private Equity? Unprofitable Tech?

### 4.2 Cash is an Option
In a Minsky Moment, Correlation $\to$ 1.
Everything falls (Stocks, Bonds, Gold).
Only Cash (USD) rises.
Holding Cash is a "Call Option on Distressed Assets."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (China Property):**
Evergrande.
borrowed to build ghost cities.
Relied on rising land values to service debt.
Halted in 2021 (Three Red Lines).
Classic Minsky Collapse.

**Exercise 2 (Margin Debt):**
FINRA Margin Debt peaks exactly at Market Tops.
Leverage is a lagging indicator of confidence and leading indicator of ruin.
