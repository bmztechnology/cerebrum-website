# Herd Behavior Information Cascades

## I. Executive Summary

**Herd Behavior** occurs when individuals ignore their private information and follow the actions of others. This leads to **Information Cascades**, where a sequence of decisions (e.g., Buy, Buy, Buy) convinces the marginal actor that "They must know something." Herding explains **Bubbles**, **Panics**, and the high correlation of assets during stress events.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Bayesian Cascade)
Player 1: High Signal $\implies$ Buy.
Player 2: Low Signal. But sees P1 Buy. Infers P1 had High Signal. P2's Low Signal is cancelled out. P2 Buys.
Player 3: Sees 2 Buys. Ignores own signal. Buys.
Result: Everyone buys, even if aggregate information is negative.
Fragility: One disclosure can collapse the cascade.

### Definition 2.2 (Reputational Herding)
Keynes: "Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally."
Fund managers hug the benchmark.
Buying IBM and losing is safe. Buying small cap and losing is career suicide.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Social Proof
Cialdini.
In uncertainty, we look to others for cues.
Stock market is the ultimate uncertainty engine.
"Volume" is a measure of social proof.

### 3.2 Convergence
Herding reduces variance of opinion.
When everyone agrees, volatility drops (temporarily).
But liquidity vanishes (everyone on one side).
The "Minsky Moment" occurs when the herd tries to reverse direction simultaneously.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Contrarian Entry
Identifying "Crowded Trades."
CFTC Commitment of Traders (COT) report.
If Speculators are 90% Long $\implies$ Herd is fully invested. No buyers left.
Short signal.

### 4.2 Momentum
Momentum *is* herding.
Riding the herd.
"The trend is your friend."
Strategy: Join the herd early, leave before the stampede.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Restaurant Problem):**
Two restaurants. Empty A and Empty B.
Customer 1 chooses A randomly.
Customer 2 sees 1 person in A. Chooses A.
Customer 100 sees packed A and empty B. Assumes A is better.
B might be better. Path dependence.

**Exercise 2 (Meme Stocks):**
GameStop.
Social coordination via Reddit.
Weaponized Herding.
Short Squeeze as the enforcement mechanism.
