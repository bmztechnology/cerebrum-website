# DIP Financing and Priming Liens

## I. Executive Summary

**Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) Financing** captures the funding of a bankrupt company during Chapter 11. Because the company is insolvent, no one lends without **Super-Priority**. The DIP Lender gets to "Prime" (jump ahead of) existing Secured Lenders. This sets up a **Priming Fight**: Existing lenders often offer the DIP themselves to protect their position ("Defensive DIP").

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Priming Lien)
New Loan (DIP) takes 1st Lien on all assets.
Old 1st Lien becomes 2nd Lien.
Old Lenders scream "Lack of Adequate Protection!"
Court allows it if:
1. Debtor cannot get credit elsewhere.
2. Old lender is "Adequately Protected" (Equity cushion or replacement lien).

### Definition 2.2 (The Roll-Up)
Condition of the DIP: "We lend you \$50M New Money, IF you 'Roll Up' our \$100M Old Money into the DIP."
Old Loan (Pre-petition) transforms into DIP Loan (Post-petition, Super-Priority).
Massive advantage for the lender.
Restructuring fees added to the pile.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Control via Budget
DIP Lender sets the budget.
"You can spend on payroll, but not on suing us."
"Milestones": Must file plan by Day 60. Must sell assets by Day 90.
DIP Lender acts as the shadow Board of Directors.
Steering the ship towards a specific exit (usually sale to the lender).

### 3.2 The creeping 363 Sale
Section 363 sale.
Selling assets free and clear of liens.
DIP Lender credit bids (uses debt as cash).
"Loan-to-Own" consummated via 363.
Faster than a full Plan of Reorganization.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Defensive DIP
Hedge Fund A owns the bonds.
Bankrupt company seeks DIP from Hedge Fund B (Shark).
Fund A realizes: "If B primes us, we die."
Fund A matches the DIP offer.
"Keeping the keys."

### 4.2 Carve-outs
Professional fees.
"We lend the DIP, but \$5M is carved out to pay the Lawyers and Bankers."
Ensures the professionals get paid (so they support the DIP).
Bankruptcy ecology.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Make-Whole in DIP):**
Can DIP lenders charge Make-Whole premiums?
Usually Interest rates are high (SOFR + 8%).
Fees (Backstop fee 3%, Commitment fee 2%).
Expensive capital.
The cost of survival.

**Exercise 2 (Equitable Subordination Risk):**
If DIP lender exerts *too much* control (Shadow Director).
Court might subordinate their claim.
"Lender Liability."
Must walk the line between Creditor and Owner.
