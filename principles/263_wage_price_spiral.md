# Wage-Price Spiral: The 1970s Nightmare

## I. Executive Summary

A **Wage-Price Spiral** creates a feedback loop where rising expectations of inflation cause workers to demand higher wages, and companies raise prices to cover the higher wage bill. This transforms a temporary "Supply Shock" (e.g., Oil Price hike) into permanent, entrenched **Stagflation**. Central Banks fear this dynamic above all else and will induce a recession to break it.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Cycle)
1.  **Shock:** CPI rises (Oil/Food). Real Wages fall.
2.  **Reaction:** Unions demand COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment).
3.  **Transmission:** Wages rise 10%.
4.  **Preservation:** Companies maintain margin by raising prices 10%.
5.  **Loop:** CPI rises again. Expectations unanchor.

### Definition 2.2 (Real Rigidities)
Mechanism that prevents Wages from falling.
Unions, Minimum Wage Laws, Multi-year contracts.
The more rigid the labor market, the harder it is to stop the spiral without high unemployment.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Expectations-Augmented Phillips Curve
$\pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \lambda(y_t - y_n)$.
If $\pi_{t-1}$ (Past Inflation) becomes the sole driver of current inflation.
The Spiral is mathematically "Unit Root" (Explosive).
Volcker's insight: You must break $\pi_{t-1}$ by shocking the system so hard people stop believing in inflation.

### 3.2 Profits vs Wages
Ideally, companies absorb wage hikes by lowering Profit Margins.
In 2022/23 ("Greedflation"), companies *expanded* margins despite rising costs.
Market Power allows pass-through.
Spiral requires Monopoly/Oligopoly power effectively.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Watching the Data
Metric: **Unit Labor Costs (ULC)**.
$ULC = \frac{Wages}{Productivity}$.
If Productivity rises 5% and Wages rise 5% $\implies$ ULC = 0%. No Inflation.
If Productivity 0% and Wages 5% $\implies$ ULC = 5%. Inflation.
Short Bonds if ULC spikes.

### 4.2 Union Stikes
UPS, UAW (Auto), SAG-AFTRA strikes in 2023.
Winning double-digit raises.
Signal: Labor has bargaining power.
Inflation is structural, not transitory.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (UK 1970s):**
"Winter of Discontent."
Unions controlled the country. 25% Inflation.
IMF Bailout needed.
Thatcher solution: Crush the Unions (Structural Reform).
Ended the spiral, but caused massive social pain.

**Exercise 2 (Japan 2023):**
The opposite problem.
BOJ *wants* a spiral.
"Shunto" (Spring Wage Negotation) target is +5%.
Trying to escape Deflationary Mindset.
A Spiral is good if you start from -1%.
