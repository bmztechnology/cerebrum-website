# Tax Equivalent Yield TEY: The Exemption

## I. Executive Summary

**Municipal Bonds (Munis)** are distinct because their interest is generally exempt from US Federal Income Tax (and often State/Local taxes). This makes them attractive to High Net Worth individuals. Comparing Munis to Taxable bonds (Corporates/Treasuries) requires calculating the **Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY)**, which adjusts the Muni yield upwards to find the "pre-tax" equivalent.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (TEY Formula)
$$ TEY = \frac{r_{muni}}{1 - t_{marginal}} $$
-   $r_{muni}$: Muni Yield (e.g., 3.0%).
-   $t_{marginal}$: Marginal Tax Rate (e.g., 37%).
$$ TEY = \frac{3.0\%}{0.63} \approx 4.76\% $$
An investor in the 37% bracket is indifferent between a 3.0% Muni and a 4.76% Corporate.

### Definition 2.2 (Triple Tax Free)
Bonds issued by your home state (e.g., NY resident buying NY City bond).
Exempt from Federal, State (NY), and City (NYC) tax.
Effective tax rate $t$ can exceed 50%.
TEY becomes massive.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Muni / Treasury Ratio
Benchmark for value.
$Ratio = \frac{AAA \text{ } MMD \text{ } Yield}{Treasury \text{ } Yield}$.
Historical Average $\approx 85-90\%$.
-   If Ratio > 100%: Munis represent "Generational Buying Opportunity" (Yielding more than Treasuries *and* tax free). Happens in liquidity crises (2008, 2020).
-   If Ratio < 70%: Munis are rich.

### 3.2 Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
Private Activity Bonds (Airports, Stadiums).
Interest *is* taxable if investor pays AMT.
Trade at higher yields ("AMT Spread") to compensate.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Bond Ladders
Retail investors build ladders (maturities 1 to 10 years).
Reinvest principal.
Passive income strategy.
Low volatility.

### 4.2 Crossover Buyers
When Muni yields rise enough (Ratio > 100%), non-taxable entities (Pension Funds, Foreigners) enter the market.
Provides a "Floor" to Muni prices.
"Muni-Treasury Arb."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Bracket Creep):**
If tax rates rise (political shift), value of Munis rises.
Muni exemption is more valuable.
Munis are a hedge against tax hikes.

**Exercise 2 (De Minimis Rule):**
Buy a Discount Muni (Price 80).
If discount is "Market Discount" (not OID).
The appreciation from 80 to 100 is taxed as **Ordinary Income**, not Capital Gains.
Tax punitive.
Discount Munis trade at wide spreads.
