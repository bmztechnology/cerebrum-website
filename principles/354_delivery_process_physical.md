# Delivery Process Physical: The Convergence

## I. Executive Summary

Most Futures are closed before expiry. However, the **Physical Delivery** mechanism is the anchor that forces price convergence. The process is a detailed "dance" involving **Notice Days**, **Warehouse Receipts**, and **Delivery vs Payment (DVP)**. Understanding this is vital to avoid "Getting stuck with the truck" (accidentally taking delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Timeline)
-   **First Notice Day:** Longs can strictly be assigned delivery. (Retail brokers force close before this).
-   **Last Trading Day:** Trading stops.
-   **Delivery Day:** Physical transfer.

### Definition 2.2 (Delivery Instrument)
-   **Warrants / Receipts:** You don't get Oil dumped on your lawn. You get a "Warehouse Receipt" for oil in Cushing, OK.
-   **Retender:** If you get executed, you can "Retender" (Sell) the receipt next month if you pay storage.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Squeeze
Cornering the market.
Accumulate huge Long Futures position.
Buy up all Physical supply (Warehouse receipts).
Shorts cannot deliver.
Must buy back Futures at any price.
Illegal (Hunt Brothers Silver), but "Soft Squeezes" happen frequently.

### 3.2 ADP (Alternative Delivery Procedure)
Buyer and Seller agree to settle privately outside exchange rules.
"I'll take delivery in Houston instead of Cushing, and pay you \$1 extra."
Flexible logistics.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the Curve
Delivery details (Storage constraints) drive the Calendar Spread.
If Cushing is full, Front Month crashes (Negative Oil).
If Cushing is empty, Convenience Yield spikes.

### 4.2 Bond Delivery (The Tail)
Short delivers the CTD bond.
Long doesn't know *which* bond they get until Notice Day.
He receives "junk" (the cheapest bond).
Must immediately sell it or repo it.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Frozen Orange Juice):**
Weather affects crop. Delivery supply threatened.
Price explodes.
Film: Trading Places.
Real life: Onion Futures banned in 1958 due to squeezes.

**Exercise 2 (Cash Settlement):**
Eurodollar / S&P 500.
No physical delivery.
Final Price = Index value.
Converges perfectly by definition.
Eliminates squeeze risk? No, manipulation of the Index set (Libor Fixing) is possible.
