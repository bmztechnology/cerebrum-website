# Political Risk Insurance MIGA

## I. Executive Summary

**Political Risk Insurance (PRI)** covers risks that commercial markets struggle to price: **Expropriation** (Nationalization), **Currency Inconvertibility**, **Political Violence**, and **Breach of Contract**. Providers include **MIGA** (World Bank arm) and Private Insurers (Lloyd's). It is the microstructure backbone of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in unstable regions.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Creeping Expropriation)
Direct Expropriation: Tank rolls into factory. "This is ours." (Rare).
Creeping: Raising royalty taxes to 99%. Canceling permits. Harassment.
Effect is the same (Loss of Value) but harder to prove claim.
PRI contracts typically define Expropriation carefully to include "measures tantamount to expropriation."

### Definition 2.2 (Breach of Contract)
Govt signs Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with energy firm.
New Govt elected. "This deal is corrupt." Stops paying.
PRI pays the investor.
PRI (MIGA) then sues the Govt.
Govt pays MIGA because it needs World Bank loans.
"The Halo Effect" of MIGA.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Subrogation
Insurer pays claim.
Insurer assumes the rights to sue the Sovereign.
Private Insurer (Lloyd's) has no leverage over a Sovereign.
MIGA/OPIC has leverage (Diplomatic/Aid).
Deterrence value.

### 3.2 Pricing the Unpriceable
Actuarial data on Coups? Sparse.
Pricing based on Country Rating, Sector Strategic Importance, and Relationship.
Rate: 0.5% - 2.0% of principal per year.
Often required by Project Finance lenders.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Currency Convertibility Coverage
Investor has profits in local currency.
CB freezes FX window.
PRI pays USD.
Insurer takes the local currency (blocked funds).
Insurer waits 10 years for unfreeze.
Time arbitrage.

### 4.2 The Russian Plane Seizure
2022 Sanctions.
Russia seized leased aircraft (AerCap).
War Risk / Confiscation.
Insurers argued "Sanctions caused it, not War?"
Massive litigation.
Redefining PRI clauses for Geopolitical conflict.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Venezuela Arbitration):**
Exxon assets seized.
ICSID Arbitration award.
Venezuela ignored it.
PRI covered some?
Enforcement of Sovereign Awards involves chasing assets (Citgo) globally.

**Exercise 2 (Preferred Creditor Status):**
MIGA is part of World Bank.
Sovereigns almost never default on World Bank.
Therefore, MIGA insurance is "Near Risk Free."
Allows commercial banks to lend with lower capital requirements (Basel relief).
