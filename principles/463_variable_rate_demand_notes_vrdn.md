# Variable Rate Demand Notes VRDN: The Put

## I. Executive Summary

**Variable Rate Demand Notes (VRDNs)** (or VRDOs) are long-term municipal bonds with a floating interest rate that resets periodically (daily/weekly). Key feature: The investor has a **Put Option** to sell the bond back to the issuer (or a Remarketing Agent) at Par with 7 days' notice. This creates a "Cash Equivalent" instrument from long-term debt. Liquidity is guaranteed by a **Letter of Credit (LOC)** from a Bank.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Reset)
**SIFMA Municipal Swap Index.**
Weekly reset rate.
Clears the market (Supply/Demand) to keep Price at Par.
If Put > Demand, Rate rises to attract buyers.

### Definition 2.2 (Liquidity Facility)
Bank LOC.
If Remarketing Agent cannot resell the put bonds (Failed Remarketing), Bank buys them.
"Bank Bonds."
Rate spikes to "Bank Rate" (Base + 2%).
Issuer must refinance quickly.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Tax-Exempt Money Market
VRDNs are the primary asset for Tax-Free Money Market Funds.
Provide daily/weekly liquidity + Tax Free income.

### 3.2 Counterparty Linkage
Credit of VRDN = Credit of Issuer + Credit of Bank (LOC).
In 2008, Banks were downgraded.
VRDNs failed (investors put them back).
LOC fees skyrocketed.
Market shrunk (shifted to "Direct Purchase" loans).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Tender Option Bonds (TOB)
Hedge Fund buys Long Term Muni Bond (5%).
Deposits in Trust.
Trust issues Floaters (VRDNs at 1%) to MMFs.
Fund keeps Residual (Inverse Floater).
Leveraged Arbitrage ($5\% - 1\% = 4\%$ plus leverage).

### 4.2 Interest Rate Hedge
Issuer sells VRDN (Float). Enters Swap (Pay Fixed, Rec Float).
Synthetically creates Fixed Rate Debt.
Cheaper than traditional Fixed Rate Bond?
Yes, if SIFMA trades lower than 67% of LIBOR (tax efficiency).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Negative Rates):**
SIFMA cannot be negative?
Floored at 0.01% usually.
Exceptional liquidity.

**Exercise 2 (Substitution):**
Issuer can switch LOC providers.
If Bank A downgraded, switch to Bank B.
Maintains the VRDN rating (VMIG 1).
