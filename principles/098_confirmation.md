# Confirmation Signals: Entry Validation

## I. Purpose
Reduce false entries by requiring multiple conditions.

## II. Types of Confirmation
1. **Price action:** Reversal candle
2. **Indicator:** RSI/Stochastic agreement
3. **Volume:** Above average
4. **Structure:** Break of level

## III. Confluence Rule
$$Entry\ only\ if: \sum Confirmations \geq N$$

Typically N = 2-3.

## IV. Common Combinations
- S/R level + Pin bar + RSI divergence
- MA cross + ADX > 25 + Higher TF trend
- Breakout + Volume spike + Retest

## V. Trade-Off
More confirmation = Fewer trades, higher accuracy
Less confirmation = More trades, lower accuracy

## VI. Avoid Over-Confirmation
Requiring too many = Missing valid entries.
