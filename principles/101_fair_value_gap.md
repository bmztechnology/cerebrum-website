# Fair Value Gap (FVG): Price Inefficiency

## I. Definition
Price gap between three candles indicating imbalance.

## II. Bullish FVG
$$Low_{candle3} > High_{candle1}$$
Gap between candle 1 high and candle 3 low.

## III. Bearish FVG
$$High_{candle3} < Low_{candle1}$$
Gap between candle 1 low and candle 3 high.

## IV. Why They Matter
- Institutional orders create gaps
- Price tends to fill gaps later
- High-probability trading zones

## V. Trading Application
Wait for price to return to FVG:
- Bullish FVG = Buy zone
- Bearish FVG = Sell zone

## VI. Mitigation
When FVG gets filled = "Mitigated"
May still hold as support/resistance.
