# Decision Fatigue and Glucose

## I. Executive Summary

**Decision Fatigue** states that the quality of decisions deteriorates after a long session of decision making. Willpower and Executive Function are finite resources, biologically linked to **Glucose** levels. Traders exhibit **Impulse Control Failure** (Overtrading, breaking rules) late in the session or after a stressful series of trades.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Ego Depletion)
Baumeister.
Self-control is a muscle. It gets tired.
Resisting a donut $\implies$ Less willpower left to resist a bad trade.
Trading is a constant act of self-control (suppressing fear/greed).

### Definition 2.2 (The Default Option)
Fatigued brains choose the default.
In trading: Default = "Do nothing" or "Follow the herd."
Fatigued Board members = "Approve the CEO's plan."
Active dissent requires energy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Circadian Rhythms
Morning: High Energy. Analytical.
Afternoon: Low Energy. Impulsive? Or Passive?
Judges grant parole 65% of time in morning, 0% before lunch.
Traders should know their biological clock.

### 3.2 The Cost of Volatility
High Volatility market $\implies$ High decision density.
"Should I sell? Should I hold?" every minute.
Rapid depletion of mental capital.
Burnout happens in high vol, not low vol.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Trading Plan
Pre-deciding.
"If X happens, I do Y."

"Automation is a battery saver for the brain."

### 4.2 Nutrition
Glucose spikes/crashes affect trading.
Intermittent fasting? Steady blood sugar.
"Don't trade hungry."
