# Outsource CIO OCIO Model

## I. Executive Summary

**Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO)** is a governance model where an institution (e.g., small Endowment, Pension) delegates full investment authority to a third-party firm (Mercer, Russell, Goldmans). Instead of advising ("You should buy X"), the OCIO decides and executes ("We bought X"). It addresses the **Governance Deficit** of volunteer investment committees and provides scale efficiencies.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Discretion)
**Non-Discretionary:** Consultant advises, Committee votes. Slow. Misses opportunities.
**Discretionary (OCIO):** OCIO acts. Reports later. Fast.
The shift from "Mother-May-I" to "Do It."

### Definition 2.2 (Fiduciary Standard)
OCIO assumes Fiduciary Liability (legal responsibility to act in best interest).
Consultants often avoid this ("We just gave advice").

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Economies of Scale
Small endowment (\$100M) cannot afford a CIO (\$500k), 3 Analysts, Bloomberg (\$25k), Risk Systems.
OCIO aggregates 100 small endowments.
Pools assets for lower fees.
Pools resources for top-tier team.

### 3.2 Conflict of Interest
proprietory Products.
Does the OCIO put clients into its own high-fee funds?
"Open Architecture" vs "Closed Architecture."
The defining ethical tension of the industry.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Asset Allocation Implementation
Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) set by Client/OCIO joint policy.
Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) managed by OCIO.
Manager Selection managed by OCIO.

### 4.2 Crisis Management
2020 Covid Crash.
Volunteer committees couldn't meet on Zoom fast enough to rebalance.
OCIOs rebalanced instantly.
Value add of speed.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fee Layering):**
OCIO fee (20 bps) + Underlying Manager fees.
Is it cheaper than an internal team?
Usually yes for AUM < \$500M. Cost crossover point.

**Exercise 2 (Performance Attribution):**
Did the OCIO outperform a static 60/40?
Or did they just add complexity?
Benchmarking the OCIO is notoriously difficult (Custom benchmarks).
