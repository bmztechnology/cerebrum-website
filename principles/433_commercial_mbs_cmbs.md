# Commercial MBS CMBS: Property Risk

## I. Executive Summary

**CMBS** securitize loans on commercial properties (Office, Retail, Hotel, Multifamily). Unlike Residential MBS (homogeneous pools), CMBS pools are **Lumpy** (70-100 large loans). Analysis focuses on the specific real estate fundamentals: **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**, **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**, and Tenant Quality. **Defeasance** replaces prepayment risk.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (DSCR)
$$ DSCR = \frac{Net Operating Income (NOI)}{Debt Service} $$
-   NOI = Rents - Expenses (Maintenance, Tax, Insurance).
-   Target DSCR > 1.25x.
-   If DSCR < 1.0, property bleeds cash. Default likely.

### Definition 2.2 (Defeasance)
Commercial loans usually have "Call Protection."
Borrower cannot simply prepay.
Must substitute collateral: Buy Treasuries sufficient to generate the remaining cashflows.
Bondholder receives Treasuries (Risk free) instead of Property Loan.
Upgrade in credit. Yield maintenance.
Removes Negative Convexity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The B-Piece
The most junior bond (unrated or BB).
"First Loss."
Underwriting rules (Dodd-Frank Risk Retention): Issuer must hold 5%?
Or B-Piece Buyer (Specialist Fund) conducts the Due Diligence (Kickouts).
Crucial gatekeeper role.

### 3.2 Property Types
-   **Multifamily:** Stable. Government support (Freddie K-Deals).
-   **Hotel:** Volatile (Daily leases). Econ sensitive.
-   **Office:** Long leases (10Y). Vacancy risk (Work From Home).
-   **Retail:** Mall anchor risk. E-commerce threat.
Correlation between types is low? (Diversification).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Single Asset Single Borrower (SASB)
Securitization of one massive loan (e.g., \$2B for a Skyscraper in NYC).
Binary risk.
Detailed asset analysis required.
Tranches AAA to Equity on one building.

### 4.2 Special Servicing
If loan defaults, it moves to Special Servicer.
SS works out the loan (Foreclose, Extend, modify).
SS fees are high.
Conflict: B-Piece buyer often appoints the SS (Controls the workout strategy).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Extension):**
Commercial loans are "Baloons."
Interest only for 10 years. Principal due at maturity.
Refinancing Risk.
If rates rise, borrower cannot refi.
"Maturity Default."
SS extends loan ("Extend and Pretend").

**Exercise 2 (Appraisal Reduction):**
Property value drops.
Appraisal Reduction Amount (ARA).
Reduces voting rights of Most Senior class? No, usually reduces interest advances?
Shifts control down the stack.
