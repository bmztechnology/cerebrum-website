# Equitable Subordination

## I. Executive Summary

**Equitable Subordination** (Section 510(c)) is the "Nuclear Option" in bankruptcy litigation. It allows a Judge to push a senior creditor to the back of the line if they engaged in **Inequitable Conduct** (Fraud, Undue Influence, Breach of Fiduciary Duty). It changes the **Absolute Priority Rule** based on moral behavior.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Benjamin Test)
1. Claimant engaged in inequitable conduct.
2. Conduct resulted in injury to other creditors or advantage to claimant.
3. Subordination is consistent with Bankruptcy Code.
High bar. Courts rarely grant it. Usually used as a threat to force settlement.

### Definition 2.2 (Deep Rock Doctrine)
Case: *Taylor v. Standard Gas (Deep Rock)*.
Parent company claimed to be a creditor of Subsidiary.
Parent had undercapitalized the Sub and mismanaged it.
Court subordinated Parent's debt to other creditors.
"Insider Debt" attracts scrutiny.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Undue Control
Lender A forces Debtor to fire CEO and hire Lender's friend.
Lender A tells Debtor which vendors to pay.
Lender A is now a "De Facto Insider."
If Company fails, Lender A's claim might be subordinated to the Vendors they stiffed.
Lenders try to avoid "Day-to-day control."

### 3.2 Recharacterization
Debt vs Equity.
Shareholder lends money to struggling company.
Calls it "Secured Note."
Bankruptcy Court: "This wasn't a loan. It was a capital contribution. No arms-length lender would have done this."
Recharacterizes Debt $\to$ Equity.
Priority lost.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Threat Letter
Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) investigates Secured Lender.
Finds email: "Let's squeeze the vendors before we file."
UCC threatens Equitable Subordination lawsuit.
Secured Lender settles: "Here is \$5M for the Unsecureds. Go away."
Litigation leverage.

### 4.2 Claim Trading Risk
Hedge Fund buys claim from Bank.
Bank had "dirty hands" (Fraud).
Does the "dirt" travel with the claim?
*Enron* decision: Yes/No split.
Market standard: Claim buyer demands indemnity for "Bad Acts" of seller.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Pony Scheme):**
Lender knows borrower is running a Ponzi.
Lender keeps lending to keep it alive (getting fees).
Court subordinates lender.
Aiding and abetting.

**Exercise 2 (Insider Preference):**
CEO pays back his own loan 1 day before filing.
Preference + Equitable Subordination.
Clawback risk.
