# Philanthropy Impact Investing

## I. Executive Summary

**Philanthropy** has evolved from check-writing (Grants) to **Impact Investing** (Investments expecting financial + social return). Wealth Management incorporates this via **Donor Advised Funds (DAFs)** and **Private Foundations**. The goal is to deploy capital to solve societal problems while optimizing tax deductions and family legacy values.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Donor Advised Fund - DAF)
"Charitable Checkbook."
Donate \$1M today (Receive Tax Deduction).
Invest the \$1M (Tax-Free Growth).
Grant money to charities over 20 years.
Low cost, easy admin, private.
Disadvantage: No control over grants (Technically "Advised").

### Definition 2.2 (Private Foundation)
Separate legal entity.
Must distribute 5% of assets annually.
High admin cost. Public tax return (990-PF).
Allows hiring family members, running programs.
Control.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Impact Spectrum
1.  **Responsible (ESG):** Do no harm (Screen negative).
2.  **Sustainable:** Select ESG leaders.
3.  **Thematic:** Clean Energy Fund.
4.  **Impact First:** Below market returns accepted (Microfinance).
5.  **Philanthropy:** -100% Return.

### 3.2 Measurement
How to measure "Social Return"?
SROI (Social Return on Investment).
GIIN Standards (IRIS+).
"Greenwashing" risk.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Program Related Investments (PRIs)
Foundations can make loans/equity investments *out of their 5% distribution bucket* if purpose is charitable.
Recycling capital.
If loan is repaid, money goes back to Foundation to be used again.
Powerful multiplier.

### 4.2 Effective Altruism
Data-driven philanthropy.
GiveWell.
Focus on "Cost per life saved" (Malaria nets).
Utilitarian approach vs Emotional giving (Alma Mater).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (DAF vs Foundation):**
\$5M threshold.
Under \$5M, DAF is better (Cost).
Over \$10M, Foundation makes sense (Control/Status).

**Exercise 2 (Intergenerational Governance):**
