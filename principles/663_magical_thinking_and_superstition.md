# Magical Thinking and Superstition

## I. Executive Summary

**Magical Thinking** is the causal attribution of unconnected events (e.g., "Lucky Numbers"). In finance, it persists despite high stakes. From **Lunar Cycles** to **Feng Shui** in Hong Kong real estate, and the **"8" Premium** in Chinese stock codes, superstitious beliefs tangibly impact asset prices, liquidity, and IPO timing. It reveals the brain's desperate search for patterns in randomness.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Numerology Premiums)
Asian Markets:
Number 8 (Prosperity). Number 4 (Death/Tetraphobia).
Limit orders cluster on 8s (e.g., 88.88).
Apartments on 4th floor trade at discount.
Codes ending in 8 have higher IPO valuations? (Evidence mixed but belief strong).

### Definition 2.2 (The Eclipse Effect)
Studies showing stock market returns correlate with:
Lunar Phases (Full moon = Lower returns? "Lunacy").
Sunshine (Cloudy days = Depressed returns).
Sports results (World Cup loss = National market drop).
Mood drives pricing.
