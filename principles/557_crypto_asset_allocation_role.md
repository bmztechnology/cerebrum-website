# Crypto Asset Allocation: Digital Gold

## I. Executive Summary

**Crypto Assets**, primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have emerged as a distinct asset class dubbed "Digital Gold." The investment thesis rests on **Scarcity** (Hard capped supply), **Decentralization** (Sovereignty resistant), and **Network Effects**. In a portfolio context, Crypto offers high **Idiosyncratic Volatility** and historically low (though rising) correlation to traditional assets, providing an **Asymmetric Return Profile** (Call Option on a new monetary system).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Stock-to-Flow Model)
Modeled on Gold.
$SF = Stock / Flow$.
Bitcoin halving every 4 years doubles SF ratio.
Scarcity drives value?
Criticism: Demand is not modeled, only Supply.

### Definition 2.2 (Metcalfe's Law)
Network Value $V \propto n^2$.
$n$ = Number of users/wallets.
Adoption curve drives valuation.
S-Curve dynamics.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Correlation Dynamics
Historically 0 correlation to S&P 500.
2020-2022: Correlation spike (High Beta Tech Stock behavior).
2023+: Decoupling?
Macro-hedge (Debasement) vs Risk-on Asset (Liquidity).
It behaves as both depending on the regime.

### 3.2 Sharpe Ratio & Impact
Bitcoin annual vol $\approx$ 60-80%.
Annual return $\approx$ 100%+ (historically).
Small allocation (1-5%) massively impacts Portfolio Volatility.
Rebalancing Bonus: Harvesting the volatility of an asset that moves 50% up and down generates a "Shannon's Demon" effect.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Custody & Counterparty Risk
"Not your keys, not your coins."
FTX / Mt. Gox collapse.
Institutional solution: Regulated Custodians (Coinbase, Fidelity) + Spot ETFs.
Removes technical barrier, introduces counterparty risk (though regulated).

### 4.2 The 1% Allocation
Asymmetric Bet.
If BTC goes to 0, portfolio loses 1%.
If BTC does a 10x, portfolio gains 10%.
Convexity makes it a rational hold for diversified portfolios despite skepticism.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Volatility Drag):**
Asset falls 50%, needs 100% to recover.
Crypto volatility is brutal on Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) vs Average Return.
DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) smooths entry.

**Exercise 2 (Smart Contracts - ETH):**
Yield generation via Staking.
Dividends?
ETH as "Tech Stock" / "Digital Oil" vs BTC as "Digital Gold."
Different investment thesis.
