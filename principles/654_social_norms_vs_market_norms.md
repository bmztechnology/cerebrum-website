# Social Norms vs Market Norms

## I. Executive Summary

Dan Ariely distinguishes between **Social Norms** (Community, reciprocity, free favors) and **Market Norms** (Exchange, money, clear value). Mixing them causes conflict. Introducing money into a social relationship often destroys it ("Crowding Out"). In finance, understanding which domain applies is critical for **Incentive Design** and **Ethics**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Daycare Experiment)
Gneezy & Rustichini.
Daycare introduced a fine for late parents (Market Norm).
Lateness *increased*.
Why? Before, lateness was Social Guilt. Now, it was a Price ("I can buy extra time for \$10").
Removing the fine did not restore the social norm. (Norms are fragile).

### Definition 2.2 (Crowding Out Motivation)
Paying kids to read books.
Intrinsic motivation (Social/Internal) replaced by Extrinsic motivation (Market).
When payment stops, reading stops.
"Turning play into work."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Incomplete Contracts (Again)
Social Norms handle the "spirit of the law."
Market Norms handle the "letter of the law."
Wall Street operates on Market Norms ("If it's legal, I do it").
Main Street operates on Social Norms ("It's wrong").
Culture clash (e.g., Foreclosures, Bailouts).

### 3.2 Gift Economy
Open Source Software (Linux).
Wikipedia.
Operates on Social Norms (Status, Altruism).
Paying contributors might ruin the ecosystem?
Cryptoeconomics tries to bridge this (Token incentives for community work).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Employee Bonuses
Cash bonus (Market) vs Vacation/Gift (Social).
Cash is judged by amount ("Only \$100?").
Gift is judged by intent ("Boss cares").
Sometimes non-monetary rewards work better.

### 4.2 Fiduciary Duty
Is it a Market relationship ("I sell you a product")?
Or a Social relationship ("I take care of you")?
The "Suitability Standard" vs "Fiduciary Standard."
Marketing tries to fake the Social ("Like a good neighbor"), legal agreement enforces the Market.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Thanksgiving Dinner):**
Offer to pay your mother \$50 for the dinner.
Offense taken.
You applied Market Norms to a Social exchange.

**Exercise 2 (Pro Bono Work):**
Lawyers will work for \$0 (Social/Charity).
They will not work for \$30/hour (Market/Insult).
Zero is a special price.
