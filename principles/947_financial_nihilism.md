# Financial Nihilism

## I. Executive Summary

**Financial Nihilism** is the belief that the "System is Rigged" and fundamental investing is dead. Driven by **Wealth Inequality**, **Central Bank Manipulation**, and **Social Media**, younger generations bypass traditional wealth building (Stocks/Bonds) for high-variance gambles (**Meme Stocks**, **Shitcoins**, **0DTE Options**). It is a rational response to an environment where **Labor Income cannot buy Capital Assets** (Housing).
