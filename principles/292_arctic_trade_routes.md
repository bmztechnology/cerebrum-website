# Arctic Trade Routes: The Melting Silk Road

## I. Executive Summary

Climate Change is opening the **Northern Sea Route (NSR)** along Russia's coast. It cuts shipping time from Asia to Europe by 40% compared to the Suez Canal. This creates a new geopolitical flashpoint. Russia claims the NSR as internal waters (toll road). The US claims it is global commons. The economic value of the Arctic (Energy + Logistics) is a major driver of "Cold War 2.0."

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Route Math)
-   Shanghai to Rotterdam via Suez: 10,500 nautical miles (35-45 days).
-   Shanghai to Rotterdam via Arctic: 6,500 nautical miles (20-25 days).
Fuel savings. Piracy free (No Houthis).
Constraint: Icebreakers needed. Seasonal (Summer).

### Definition 2.2 (UNCLOS Article 234)
Gives coastal states right to regulate ice-covered areas for "environmental protection."
Russia uses this to demand permits/escorts for NSR.
A legal shield for sovereignty claims.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Resource Scramble
Arctic holds 30% of undiscovered Gas, 13% of Oil.
Rare Earths in Greenland.
As permafrost melts, extraction becomes cheaper? Or harder (mud)?
Yamal LNG (Russia): Major project supplying China.

### 3.2 The Icebreaker Gap
Russia: 40+ Icebreakers (Many Nuclear).
US: 2 operational (Old).
China: Building "Polar Silk Road" fleet.
Russia dominates the logistics of the route.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Greenland Independence?
Trump tried to buy Greenland. Mocked.
But strategically sound.
Rare Earths + GIUK Gap control.
If Greenland becomes independent from Denmark, it becomes a US/China vassal contest.

### 4.2 Shipping Stocks
Maersk / COSCO.
NSR viability changes fleet composition (Ice-class hulls).
Insurance rates for Arctic heavily influence viability.
Long term: Short Suez Canal (Egypt revenue).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Svalbard Treaty):**
Demilitarized zone.
Russia operates coal mines there.
NATO territory (Norway).
Potential flashpoint for hybrid warfare (Cable cutting).

**Exercise 2 (Thawing Permafrost):**
Infrastructure damage.
Russian pipelines/cities sinking into mud.
Cost of maintenance explodes.
Climate paradox: Opens route, destroys ports.
