# Yield Curve Shapes: Term Structure

## I. Executive Summary

The **Yield Curve** plots yields against maturity. Its shape implies market expectations about future interest rates and economic growth. The three main theories explaining the shape are **Pure Expectations**, **Liquidity Preference**, and **Market Segmentation**. The curve can be **Normal** (Upward), **Inverted** (Downward), **Flat**, or **Humped**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Slopes)
-   **Normal:** 2Y < 10Y. (Growth Exp + Risk Premium).
-   **Inverted:** 2Y > 10Y. (Recession signal).
-   **Steepening:** Spread 10Y-2Y increases. (Bull Steepener vs Bear Steepener).
-   **Flattening:** Spread decreases.

### Definition 2.2 (Theories)
1.  **Expectations:** Forward rates = Expected future spot rates.
2.  **Liquidity Pref:** Investors demand premium for locking money up longer. Creates upward bias.
3.  **Segmentation:** Pension funds buy 30Y (Liability match). Banks buy 2Y (Liquidity). Supply/Demand in buckets.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Inversion as Recession Predictor
Campbell Harvey (1986).
Inverted 3M/10Y curve predicted every recession since 1950.
Why? Central Bank hikes short rates (2Y up) to kill inflation. Long rates (10Y) fall anticipating the slowdown/rate cuts.
"The bond market is smarter than the stock market."

### 3.2 Bear Flattening vs Bull Steepening
-   **Bear Flattener:** Short rates rise faster than long rates (Fed Hiking).
-   **Bull Steepener:** Short rates fall faster than long rates (Fed Cutting).
-   **Bear Steepener:** Long rates rise faster (Inflation fears / Debt crisis).
-   **Bull Flattener:** Long rates fall (Deflationary growth?).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Curve Trading
"Trading the Spread."
Buy 2Y / Sell 10Y (Betting on Steepening).
Positive Carry (if curve is normal).
If Curve Inverts, trade loses.

### 4.2 Corporate Financing
If Curve is inverted.
Corporates issue Long Term debt (cheaper than short term bank loans).
Locks in low long rates before recession.
"Opportunistic Issuance."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Forward Rates):**
If 1Y = 3% and 2Y = 4%.
Implied 1Y rate starting in 1 year ($f_{1,1}$)?
$(1.04)^2 = (1.03) \times (1 + f)$.
$1.0816 / 1.03 \approx 1.05$.
Forward rate is 5%.
Market expects rates to rise.

**Exercise 2 (The Hump):**
6M rate > 2Y rate < 30Y rate.
Fed expected to hike then cut quickly.
"Volcker Hump."
