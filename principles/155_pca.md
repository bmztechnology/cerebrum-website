# Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality Reduction

## I. Executive Summary

Global markets are driven by a few common forces (Global Liquidity, Dollar, Risk On/Off). Yet we track thousands of stocks. **PCA** decomposes the correlation matrix of these thousands of assets into a few orthogonal **Principal Components (Eigenvectors)** that explain the majority of the variance. It reduces the "Noise" of idiosyncratic risk and isolates the "Signal" of systemic risk.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Eigen-Decomposition)
Covariance Matrix $\Sigma$.
Find vectors $v$ and scalars $\lambda$ such that:
$$\Sigma v = \lambda v$$
-   $v$: Principal Component (Weights of a portfolio).
-   $\lambda$: Eigenvalue (Variance explained by that PC).

### Definition 2.2 (Transform)
$Z = X W$.
Projects data $X$ onto Principal Components $W$.
$Z_1$ (PC1) is the Market Factor.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Market Factor (PC1)
In equities, the first eigenvector (PC1) almost always has positive weights for all stocks.
It corresponds to the "Market Mode" (Beta).
Explains ~60% of variance.

### 3.2 The Slope Factor (PC2)
In Yield Curves (Rates), PC2 corresponds to the "Slope" (Short vs Long Term).
In Equities, PC2 often segments Value vs Growth or Cyclical vs Defensive.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Statistical Arbitrage (Residual Trading)
Model stock returns: $R_i = \beta_1 PC1 + \beta_2 PC2 + \epsilon_i$.
Trade the residual $\epsilon_i$.
If $\epsilon_i$ is large positive, the stock "outperformed its factors." Mean reversion suggests Short.
This is "PCA-based Pairs Trading" on steroids (Generalized Pairs).

### 4.2 Systemic Risk Monitor
Calculate "Absorption Ratio": $\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i / TotalVariance$.
If Absorption Ratio rises, markets are becoming more correlated (Fragile).
*Signal:* Correlation Spike $\implies$ Crash Imminent.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Yield Curve):**
PCA on interest rates (1M, 3M, ... 30Y).
PC1: Parallel Shift (Level). 90% var.
PC2: Tilt (Slope). 8% var.
PC3: Curvature (Butterfly). 2% var.
Trading "Butterfly Spreads" targets PC3.

**Exercise 2 (Orthogonality):**
$PC1 \cdot PC2 = 0$.
The factors are uncorrelated by definition.
Building a portfolio of PC Factors guarantees diversification (mathematically).
