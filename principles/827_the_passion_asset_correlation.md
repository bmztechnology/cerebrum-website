# The Passion Asset Correlation

## I. Executive Summary

**Passion Assets** (Art, Cars, Watches) were traditionally considered **Uncorrelated** to Equities. However, in the era of **excess liquidity** (QE), they have become highly correlated with the **Wealth Effect**. When the S&P 500 and Crypto rally, the "Winnings" spill over into Rolexes and Ferraris. This chapter analyzes the **Correlation Matrix** and the **Beta** of Luxury against the Money Supply (M2).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Wealth Effect Beta)
$$ R_{Luxury} = \alpha + \beta_{Eq} R_{S\&P} + \beta_{Crypto} R_{BTC} + \epsilon $$
Rolex Prices 2021: $\beta_{Crypto}$ was dominant.
Crypto crash $\implies$ Rolex crash (WatchCharts Index).
"Rolex is a levered bet on Ethereum?"

### Definition 2.2 (Liquidity Lag)
Stocks crash Monday.
Watches crash... 3 months later.
Why? Illiquidity / Sticky prices.
Dealers refuse to lower prices until forced (margin calls).
Arbitrage the lag: Short Luxury Stocks (LVMH) when Crypto cracks, before the physical goods drop.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Luxury as a monetary phenomenon
Scarcity assets ($Supply \approx 0$).
Price is purely a function of Money Supply / Velocity.
Cantillon Effect target.
First recipients of new money buy scarce assets.
Inflation Hedge? Or Liquidity Sponge?

### 3.2 Demographics
Gen Z / Millennial wealth favors "Flex" assets over "Yield" assets.
Preference shift: Experience/Status > Dividends.
Structural tailwind for Collectibles.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Watch-Stock Arb
Watches of Switzerland (WOS) stock vs Rolex Grey Market Index.
If Grey Market collapses, WOS earnings will lag.
Short WOS.
Data source: WatchCharts / Chrono24 scraping.

### 4.2 Diversification Failure
In 2008, Art fell 30%.
In 2022, Art fell?.
High correlation in tails.
"Passion Assets" are not a hedge against systemic deflation (Cash is needed).
They *are* a hedge against currency debasement.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Ferrari Index):**
Ferrari 250 GTO index.
Outperformed Berkshire Hathaway?
Maintenance costs (Carry) must be deducted.
"Adjustment for enjoyment" (Dividends of pleasure).
Hard to quantify "Joy Alpha."

**Exercise 2 (Hermes Birkin):**
"Better investment than Gold."
Strictly restricted supply (The "List").
Secondary market premium 100%.
Is it a bubble?
Or structural scarcity managed by a master monopolist?
