# Hindsight Bias Narrative Fallacy

## I. Executive Summary

**Hindsight Bias** ("I knew it all along") is the tendency to see past events as having been predictable. It distorts our assessment of probability and risk. The **Narrative Fallacy** (Taleb) is our biological need to construct coherent stories around random facts to make sense of the world. Together, they create a false sense of understanding, leading to **Overconfidence in Forecasting**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Creeping Determinism)
Before event: $P(Crash) = 5\%$.
After event: "It was inevitable."
Memory of the prior uncertainty is overwritten.
Investors blame managers for "not seeing the obvious."

### Definition 2.2 (The Storytelling Animal)
Information is stored as stories, not raw data.
"Stock fell because of inflation." (Causal link invented).
Stock might have fallen due to random selling.
We abhor randomness; we crave Cause-and-Effect.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Outcome Bias
Judging a decision by its outcome, not the quality of the decision process.
Win Lotter $\implies$ "Good Strategy."
Lose prudent bet $\implies$ "Bad Strategy."
Markets are probabilistic; outcomes are noisy.

### 3.2 The Just-So Story
Evolutionary biology criticism also applies to markets.
Post-hoc rationalization.
Market wrap reports: "Dow falls 100 points on fears of X."
Check next day: "Dow rises 100 points as fears of X subside."
Journalism as fiction.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading Journal
Process: Write down rationale *before* the trade.
"I am buying because X, Y, Z. Risks are A, B."
Review later.
Prevents Hindsight Bias ("I actually knew X was weak").
Honest audit of prediction calibration.

### 4.2 Counterfactual History
Simulation.
What if Lehman hadn't failed?
What if Covid happened in 2010?
Understanding that the realized history is just one path of a Monte Carlo simulation.
"Alternative Histories."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Monday Morning Quarterback):**
Sports analogy.
Easy to call the play after seeing the defense.
In trading: "You should have shorted the top."
The top was only visible in hindsight.

**Exercise 2 (Calibrating "I knew it"):**
Ask experts to assign probabilities to future events.
Check score 1 year later.
Tetlock's "Superforecasting."
Most pundits are worse than random chance.
