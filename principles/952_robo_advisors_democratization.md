# Robo Advisors and Democratization

## I. Executive Summary

**Robo-Advisors** (Betterment, Wealthfront) commoditized **Asset Allocation**. By automating MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory) and Tax-Loss Harvesting, they brought "Private Bank" services to the middle class for 25bps. The future is **"Self-Driving Money"**: AI that not only invests but manages cash flow, pays bills, and optimizes the entire financial life of the user.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Tax-Loss Harvesting - TLH)
Sell a loser to realize a loss (Tax Asset).
Immediately buy a highly correlated substitute (e.g., Sell Coke, Buy Pepsi/ETF) to maintain exposure.
Avoid "Wash Sale" rule.
Algos can monitor this daily across 500 stocks.
Human advisors cannot.
"Tax Alpha" of 1-2% per year.

### Definition 2.2 (Goal-Based Optimization)
Not "Maximize Return."
But "Maximize Probability of affording House in 5 years."
Dynamic Glidepath.
As goal approaches, risk reduces automatically.
Liability-Driven Investing (LDI) for retail.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Low-Cost Revolution
Vanguard Effect.
Fees matter more than Alpha.
Robos drive fees to zero (Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is free).
They monetize via:
1. Cash Drag (Keeping 6% in cash and earning spread).
2. Order Flow (PFOF).
3. Cross-selling (Mortgages).

### 3.2 The Trust Boundary
Users trust Robos with small money (\$50k).
Trust Humans with big money (\$5M).
Why? "Someone to blame" / Emotional handling during crashes.
Hybrid Model (Cyborg): Robo does math, Human holds hand.
The dominant model for RIA industry.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Direct Indexing
Replicating the S&P 500 by buying all 500 stocks individually.
Why?
Customization: "Buy S&P 500 but exclude Oil."
Tax Efficiency: Harvest losses on individual stocks even if Index is up.
Democratized by fractional shares and zero commissions.
Threat to the ETF structure?

### 4.2 Financial Wellness (The Super App)
Integrate Bank + Brokerage + Credit Card.
AI analyses spend.
"You spend too much on coffee. I diverted \$5 to your Roth IRA."
Nudging behavior (Thaler).
Paternalistic Finance.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Panic Button):**
Robo-Advisors saw fewer withdrawals during 2020 crash than human-advised accounts?
UI Friction.
"Are you sure you want to change your plan?"
Pop-up education.
Slowing down the impulsive brain (System 1).

**Exercise 2 (Generative Advisors):**
ChatGPT interface on top of Robo.
"Explain why my portfolio is down."
"It is down because Tech sell-off. Here is a chart. Stick to the plan."
Hyper-personalized communication at scale.
