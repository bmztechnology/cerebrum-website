# Diaspora Bonds

## I. Executive Summary

**Diaspora Bonds** are sovereign debt issued specifically to a country's emigrants (Diaspora). The "Patriotic Discount" allows the country to borrow cheaper than market rates. The microstructure relies on **Retail Distribution** (not Institutional) and **Emotional Marketing**. They are successful in **Israel** (Israel Bonds) and **India**, but have failed in many African nations due to lack of trust.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Patriotic Discount)
Market Yield for Country X: 10%.
Diaspora Yield: 6%.
Why buy?
1. Patriotism / Charity.
2. Liability Matching (Sending money home anyway, saving for retirement in home currency).
3. Perception of lower risk ("The government won't default on its own people?").

### Definition 2.2 (KYC/AML Hurdles)
Selling retail bonds in the USA (SEC registration).
Expensive.
"Reg S" exemptions?
Hard to market to taxi drivers in NYC without violating securities laws.
Israel has a special US exemption act.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Counter-Cyclical Resilience
Foreign Investors (Hot Money) flee at first sign of trouble.
Diaspora (Cold Money) stays.
During war/crisis, Diaspora investment often increases.
Stable funding base.

### 3.2 The Trust Deficit
If Diaspora left because of corruption/regime.
They won't buy the bond.
"Why fund the dictator who drove me out?"
Success requires legitimate governance or strong external threat (Israel).
