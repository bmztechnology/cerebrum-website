# Remittance Flows Hawala and Crypto

## I. Executive Summary

**Remittances** (Migrants sending money home) are a massive capital flow (\>\$700B/year), often exceeding FDI and Foreign Aid for developing nations. The microstructure competes between **Formal Channels** (Western Union / SWIFT - High Fees) and **Informal Channels** (Hawala / Crypto - Low Fees, Regulatory Risk). This flow is **Counter-Cyclical** (Migrants send more when home country is in crisis).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Hawala / Hundi)
Trust-based value transfer without physical movement.
Hawaladar A (Dubai) takes cash from Worker.
Terms: "Pay my mom in Karachi."
Hawaladar B (Karachi) pays mom in Rupees.
Settlement: A and B balance books via trade invoicing (A sends electronics to B).
Velocity: Instant. Cost: < 1%. KYC: Zero.

### Definition 2.2 (The Remittance Corridors)
USA $\to$ Mexico.
GCC $\to$ India/Philippines.
Cost of Corridor determined by competition and volume.
UN SDG Target: Reduce cost to < 3%.
Banks de-risking (closing accounts of Money Transfer Operators) pushes flow to shadow channels.
