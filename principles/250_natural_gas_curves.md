# Natural Gas Curves: The Widowmaker

## I. Executive Summary

**Natural Gas** is the most volatile commodity on earth. Unlike oil, it is difficult to store and transport (pipeline dependent). Prices are strictly regional (Henry Hub vs TTF vs JKM). The futures curve frequently flips between extreme **Contango** (Store it!) and extreme **Backwardation** (Burn it now!). The "Widowmaker" trade involves betting on the spread between March (Winter, empty storage) and April (Shoulder season, refill).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Heating Degree Days - HDD)
Proxy for demand.
$HDD = \max(0, 65^\circ F - T_{avg})$.
Cold Winter $\to$ High HDD $\to$ Storage Withdrawal $\to$ Price Spike.
Weather Models (GFS/ECMWF) drive price action more than macroeconomics.

### Definition 2.2 (The Widowmaker Spread)
March Futures vs April Futures.
March is the last month of Winter withdrawal.
April is the first month of Injection.
If Winter is cold, stocks are low: March explodes, April flat. Spread widens.
If Winter is warm: March collapses to clear the pipes.
Volatility is 100%+. A marcro trade that kills retail.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Substitution Effect
If Gas > $5/MMBtu.
Power plants switch to Coal.
If Gas < $2/MMBtu.
Power plants switch to Gas.
This "Coal Switching Price" acts as a soft ceiling/floor for gas.

### 3.2 LNG Linkage
US Gas (Henry Hub) used to be $3. Europe (TTF) $8.
Now US exports LNG.
Prices are converging.
US consumers now compete with German buyers.
Volatility is imported.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Freeport Explosion (2022)
Freeport LNG export terminal exploded.
LNG exports stopped.
Gas was trapped in US market.
US Price Crashed (-40%).
EU Price Spiked (+50%).
Example of infrastructure fragility de-linking markets.

### 4.2 Negative Prices (Permian)
In West Texas (Waha Hub), Gas is a byproduct of Oil drilling.
No pipelines to take it away.
Producers PAY you to take the gas (Price = -$2).
Or they Flare it (Burn it).
Flaring Regulation $\to$ Forced negative pricing.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Amaranth Advisors):**
Brian Hunter bet on the March/April spread.
Weather didn't cooperate.
Lost $6 Billion in a week. Fund collapsed.
Natural Gas has "Fat Tails" (Kurtosis).

**Exercise 2 (Storage Seasonality):**
Injection Season: April - October. (Build stocks).
Withdrawal Season: November - March. (Burn stocks).
The curve shape dictates the incentive to store.
