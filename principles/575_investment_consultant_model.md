# Investment Consultant Model

## I. Executive Summary

**Investment Consultants** (e.g., Cambridge Associates, NEPC, Willis Towers Watson) are the gatekeepers of institutional capital. They advise Pensions and Endowments on Asset Allocation and Manager Selection. Historically **Non-Discretionary** (Advisory only), they hold immense power as their "Buy Lists" determine which Asset Managers receive flows. They focus heavily on **Process**, **Peer Group Analysis**, and **Risk Reporting**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Search)
Client issues RFP (Request for Proposal).
Consultant screens universe (eVestment database).
Shortlists 3 managers.
"Beauty Parade" (Finalist presentation).
Consultant recommends one.
Committee votes.

### Definition 2.2 (Benchmarking)
Comparing Client vs "Peer Universe."
"Did we beat the median Public Pension?"
Herd behavior: If everyone copies the median, nobody underperforms significantly (Career risk minimization).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Agency Issues
Consultant paid flat fee (hard dollar) or by managers (soft dollar conferences)?
Conflict: "Pay to Play."
Consultants tend to favor big, brand-name managers (Safe choices).
"Nobody gets fired for hiring BlackRock."

### 3.2 The Value Add
Is it Alpha? Or Governance?
Value is often in "Keeping the committee disciplined" (preventing panic selling).
Policy Statement creation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Asset Liability Modeling (ALM) Studies
Every 3 years.
Consultant runs Monte Carlo simulations.
Determines the optimal SAA (Strategic Asset Allocation).
The "Bible" for the next 3 years.

### 4.2 ESG Implementation
Consultants driving the ESG adoption.
Screening managers for UN PRI signature.
Carbon footprint reporting.
Gatekeepers of sustainability.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Herding):**
Consultants all recommend the same "Top Quartile" managers.
Flows flood those managers. Alpha decays.
The "Consultant Curse."

**Exercise 2 (Fee Compression):**
Consulting fees are low pressure.
Firms moving to OCIO (higher fees) to survive.
The death of the pure advisory model?
