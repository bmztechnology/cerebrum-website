# Volume Profile: The Auction Map

## I. Executive Summary

Volume Profile (Market Profile) is distinct from standard "Volume per Time" (the histogram at the bottom of the chart). It measures **Volume per Price** (horizontal histogram). It tells us *at which price levels* the most business was transacted. This reveals the "Fair Value" agreed upon by the market and the "Thin" zones where the market moves rapidly.

## II. Formal Definitions

### 2.1 Point of Control (POC)
The specific price level with the highest traded volume in the profile.
-   *Significance:* The "Magnet." The market considers this Fair Value. Price reverts here.

### 2.2 Value Area (VA)
The range of prices surrounding the POC that contains 70% (1 standard deviation) of the total volume.
-   **VAH (Value Area High):** Resistance.
-   **VAL (Value Area Low):** Support.

### 2.3 High Volume Node (HVN) vs Low Volume Node (LVN)
-   **HVN:** A peak in the profile. Acceptance. Slow movement (Chop).
-   **LVN:** A valley in the profile. Rejection. Fast movement (breakout).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Auction Market Theory (AMT)
The market's purpose is to facilitate trade.
-   **Balance:** Market stays in the VA. Buyers and Sellers agree on price.
-   **Imbalance:** News shifts perception. Price breaks VA to search for a new area of agreement.

### 3.2 The Bell Curve
Over a long enough sample, the Volume Profile creates a Gaussian Normal Distribution (Bell Curve) rotated 90 degrees.
-   POC is the Mean ($\mu$).
-   VA is $\mu \pm 1\sigma$.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Reversion Trade
-   **Setup:** Price opens inside yesterday's VA but moves to the edge.
-   **Trigger:** Rejection of VAH or VAL.
-   **Trade:** Fade back to POC. (80% Probability).

### 4.2 The Breakout (Initiative Selling/Buying)
-   **Setup:** Price opens *outside* yesterday's VA.
-   **Trigger:** Price retests the VA edge and fails to re-enter.
-   **Trade:** Follow the trend away from value. The market is "Seeking Value" elsewhere.

### 4.3 The LVN Bridge
Price moves fast through Low Volume Nodes.
-   *Strategy:* If price breaks into an LVN, target the *next* HVN. There is no "friction" (volume support) in the LVN to stop it.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Reading the Profile):**
Profile is "b" shaped (High volume at bottom, low volume at top).
What does this mean? (Long Liquidation or Short Covering. Sellers pushed price down, but buyers absorbed everything at the lows. Bullish accumulation).

**Exercise 2 (S/R Flip):**
Price breaks above the POC.
It pulls back.
Why does the POC act as Support? (Traders who sold at POC are underwater. They buy to close at Breakeven, adding demand).

**Exercise 3 (Day Types):**
Explain a "Double Distribution" day.
(Two Bell curves separated by a thin LVN. Indicates a trend day where value shifted completely from Level A to Level B).
