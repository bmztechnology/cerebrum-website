# Pre Packs vs Freefalls

## I. Executive Summary

**Bankruptcy Speed** is a critical variable. A **Pre-Pack** (Pre-Packaged) Chapter 11 is negotiated *before* filing: Creditors vote YES, then company files to get Court approval (Duration: 30-60 days). A **Freefall** Chapter 11 is filed without a plan (Emergency), leading to chaos, high fees, and potential liquidation. Microstructure focuses on the **Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA)**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The RSA)
 Contract between Debtor and Buying Creditors (Consenting Lenders).
 Terms: "We agree to vote YES on Plan X, provided you file by Date Y."
 If Debtor breaches (e.g., shops for a better deal), RSA terminates.
 "Lock-up Agreement."

### Definition 2.2 (The Pre-Arranged)
Middle ground.
Plan is negotiated, but ballots not solicited until *after* filing.
Slower than Pre-Pack. Faster than Freefall.
Used when you have a deal with the Senior Lenders but need to sue the Juniors to shut them up.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Melting Ice Cube
Business value decays in bankruptcy.
Customers leave. Talent leaves.
Vendors demand Cash on Delivery (COD).
Speed preserves value.
Pre-Pack is the optimal value preservation tool.

### 3.2 Solicitation Rules
SEC rules on soliciting votes.
Pre-Pack solicitation must comply with non-bankruptcy securities laws (Disclosure Statement).
If Disclosure is "inadequate," voting is void.
Risk: Court rejects the Pre-Pack voting process. Case turns into Freefall.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Drop-Dead Date
Lenders set tight milestones in RSA.
"Must emerge by Day 45."
Forces Judge to rule fast.
"We are holding a gun to the head of the estate."
Creates pressure on Holdouts.

### 4.2 The 24-Hour Bankruptcy
Blue Bird Body Co.
Filed and emerged in 32 hours.
"Pre-Packaged" to the extreme.
Only possible if *everyone* (Unsecureds included) is paid or agrees.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Hertz Freefall):**
Hertz filed (COVID). No plan.
Chaos.
But Used Car prices spiked.
Assets appreciated.
Shareholders got paid (Rare).
Luck, not strategy.

**Exercise 2 (RSA Bust):**
Creditors sign RSA.
Competitor bids higher for assets.
Fiduciary Duty of Board requires them to consider superior bid ("Fiduciary Out").
RSA breaks.
Lenders sue.
