# Framing Effects Context Dependence

## I. Executive Summary

**Framing Effects** occur when valid decisions are influenced by the way information is presented. Equivalent economic choices (Gain vs Loss, Percent vs Dollar, Monthly vs Annual) elicit contradictory responses. This violates the **Invariance Principle** of rational choice. Marketers and politicians weaponize framing; astute investors must "de-frame" data to see the underlying reality.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Gain Frame vs Loss Frame)
Problem A: "saves 200 lives." (Risk Averse choice).
Problem B: "400 people die." (Risk Seeking choice).
Mathematically identical ($N=600$).
Choice shifts from 72% support to 22% support based on framing.
Prospect Theory: We are risk-averse in gains, risk-seeking in losses.

### Definition 2.2 (Mental Accounting Framing)
"Cash Discount" vs "Credit Surcharge."
"\$100 a month" vs "\$1,200 a year." (Temporal reframing).
"98% Fat Free" vs "2% Fat."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Asian Disease Problem
Tversky & Kahneman (1981).
The foundational experiment.
Shows that preferences are not fixed; they are constructed on the fly based on the frame.
Implication: Opinion Polls are useless if the question is framed poorly.

### 3.2 Reference Dependence
The frame sets the reference point.
"Salary of \$50k" feels Good if coworker makes \$40k.
"Salary of \$50k" feels Bad if coworker makes \$60k.
Framing relative to peers (Relative Deprivation).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Financial Product Marketing
"Capital Protected Note with 5% cap" (Loss Averse Frame).
vs
"Upside Call Option" (Gain Frame).
Same payoff structure. The "Protection" frame sells better to retail.

### 4.2 News Analysis
"Unemployment rises to 5%" (Negative).
"Employment rate is 95%" (Positive).
Media chooses the frame to drive narrative.
Algo traders must parse sentiment based on the frame, not just the data.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Dividend Frame):**
Company pays dividend $\implies$ Stock drops by dividend amount.
Total wealth unchanged.
Frame: "Income Check!" (Positive).
Reality: "Forced partial liquidation" (Neutral/Negative tax).
Investors love the Income frame.

**Exercise 2 (Base Rate Neglect Framing):**
"This disease kills 1,000 people." (Panic).
"This disease kills 0.0003% of the population." (Calm).
Absolute numbers (Frequency frame) scare people more than Percentages (Probability frame).
