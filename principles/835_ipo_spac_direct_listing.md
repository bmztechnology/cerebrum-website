# IPO vs SPAC vs Direct Listing

## I. Executive Summary

The **Public Listing** involves moving an asset from Private (Illiquid) to Public (Liquid). The traditional **IPO** (Underwritten) has been challenged by **Direct Listings** (No new capital, market price discovery) and **SPACs** (Blank Check merger). Each mechanism has distinct microstructure incentives regarding **Pricing Pop**, **Lock-ups**, and **Sponsor Promote**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The IPO Pop)
Banks price IPO at \$20. Stocks opens at \$30.
\$10 "Left on the table" for the Issuer.
Given to the Bank's clients (Allocations) as a gift.
Cost of "Marketing" or "Systematic Underpricing"?
Direct Listing eliminates the Pop (Shareholders sell directly to market).

### Definition 2.2 (SPAC Arbitrage)
**Sponsor:** Puts up 3% Risk Capital. Gets 20% Promote (Equity).
**IPO Investors:** Put in \$10. Get Share + Warrant. Can redeem \$10 + interest if they dislike the merger.
**Target:** Gets to go public faster with "Forward Looking Statements" (Prohibited in IPO).
The "Redemption Arb": Hedge funds buy IPO units, keep warrants (free upside), redeem shares (risk-free).
Value extraction from long-term holders.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Information Asymmetry
**IPO:** Roadshow. Vetting by Bankers.
**Direct Listing:** Market sets price. Tech companies (Spotify/Slack) with brand recognition.
**SPAC:** Backdoor listing. Less scrutiny?
Regulators (SEC) cracked down on SPAC "Projections" in 2022.
"De-SPAC" process performance has been poor.

### 3.2 Lock-up Dynamics
**IPO:** Insiders locked 180 days.
**Direct Listing:** No lock-up. Immediate liquidity.
**SPAC:** Sponsor locked 1 year. PIPE investors unlocked?
Microstructure: Trading the "Lock-up Expiry" short.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Comparison of Costs
IPO: 7% Underwriting Fee. High Pop Cost.
Direct Listing: Low Fees. Zero Pop Cost.
SPAC: Massive Dilution (Sponsor Promote 20% + Warrants). Most expensive cost of capital.
Why use SPAC? Certainty of Valuation (Negotiated deal) vs IPO volatility.

### 4.2 The PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity)
SPAC trust is \$200M. Target needs \$500M.
Raise \$300M PIPE from fidelity.
PIPE validates the valuation.
If PIPE falls through, deal dies (Termination condition).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Warrant Overhang):**
DraftKings (SPAC).
Stock rises.
Warrants exercised.
Dilution hits.
Stock drops.
Technical ceiling on price until warrants clear.

**Exercise 2 (Reference Price):**
Direct Listing.
Nasdaq sets reference based on private trades.
Auction open.
Price discovery happens in the opening cross.
True supply/demand match.
