# Hyperbolic Discounting Time Inconsistency

## I. Executive Summary

**Hyperbolic Discounting** is the tendency for people to choose a smaller-sooner reward over a larger-later reward as the delay occurs sooner rather than later. Unlike **Exponential Discounting** (Rational), which is consistent, Hyperbolic Discounting creates **Time Inconsistency**: we plan to be virtuous (Save) in the future, but act impulsively (Spend) in the present. This explains the retirement savings crisis.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Discount Function)
Exponential: $D(t) = \delta^t$. (Constant discount rate).
Hyperbolic: $D(t) = \frac{1}{1 + kt}$.
Result: Discount rate is high for near-term ($t=0$ to $t=1$) and low for long-term ($t=10$ to $t=11$).
"I prefer \$100 today over \$110 tomorrow." (Implied Rate > 3650%).
"I prefer \$110 in 31 days over \$100 in 30 days." (Implied Rate < low).
Preference reversal based on time framing.

### Definition 2.2 (Present Bias)
The "Beta-Delta" model (Laibson).
$\beta$ parameter represents the "Immediacy" bias.
If $\beta < 1$, the present is overweighted relative to all future periods.
Traders take small profits NOW rather than waiting for the larger target NEXT WEEK.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Multiple Selves Problem
Shelling (1984).
"Future Self" wants to be thin and rich.
"Present Self" wants a donut and a new car.
They are engaged in a war.
Saving is a transfer from Present Self to Future Self. Present Self resists.

### 3.2 Dynamic Inconsistency
Monday: "I will start gym on Wednesday."
Wednesday arrives (Now it is 'Present'): "I will start gym on Friday."
The plan is optimal at $t=0$, but suboptimal at $t=1$.
Rational agents stick to the plan. Humans deviate.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Commitment Devices
"Tying yourself to the mast."
Illiquid Assets (Housing / 401k with penalties).
People *pay* for illiquidity to protect themselves from their own Hyperbolic Discounting.
Rotated CDs (Certificates of Deposit).

### 4.2 Save More Tomorrow (SMarT) Impact
Benartzi & Thaler.
Ask employee: "Commit your *next* raise to savings."
Since the raise is in the *future*, Hyperbolic Discounting applies a low discount rate (Rationality prevails).
Commitment is locked in.
When raise arrives, savings auto-deduct.
Bypasses Present Bias.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Credit Card Debt):**
High interest debt is the price of Hyperbolic Discounting.
Paying 20% APR to consume Today instead of Tomorrow.
Financial literacy helps, but biological impulse (Dopamine) is stronger.

**Exercise 2 (The Marshmallow Test):**
Mischel.
Ability to delay gratification (Resist Hyperbolic Discounting) at age 4 predicts SAT scores and Wealth at age 30.
Trading edge = Patience.
