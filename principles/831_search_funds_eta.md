# Search Funds and Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition

## I. Executive Summary

**Search Funds** are a vehicle for young entrepreneurs (MBA grads) to raise capital to **acquire one single SME** (Small-Medium Enterprise), become CEO, and grow it. Unlike PE (Portfolio of companies), Search is **Concentrated**. Returns rely on identifying "Boring Businesses" with recurring revenue and low modernization, applying professional management to unlock value.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Search Capital)
Step 1: Raise "Search Capital" (\$500k) from 10 investors.
Covers salary/travel for 2 years while looking for a target.
Step 2: Find Target (\$10M - \$30M EV).
Step 3: Raise "Acquisition Capital." Search investors get Pro-Rata right + Step-up (e.g., their \$50k search capital converts at 1.5x).

### Definition 2.2 (The Economics)
Searcher Salary: Low (\$100k).
Equity Upside: 20-25% of Common Equity (vesting over time / performance).
Investors: Get Preferred Returns + 75% of Equity.
Target Returns: 30%+ IRR. (High risk, high reward).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Silver Tsunami
Baby Boomers retiring.
Own millions of profitable, unsexy businesses (HVAC,Vertical Software, Niche Manufacturing).
No children want to take over.
Liquidity crisis for owners.
Search Funds provide the exit solution.

### 3.2 Information Asymmetry
These businesses are not on Bloomberg.
Broker networks / Cold calling.
"Proprietary Deal Flow."
Success depends on the Searcher's hustle to find a seller *before* an auction starts.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The "SaaS-ify" Play
Buy a service business (e.g., Translation agency).
Install software.
Convert "Project Revenue" to "Subscription Revenue."
Valuation Multiple expands from 4x EBITDA (Service) to 4x Revenue (SaaS).
