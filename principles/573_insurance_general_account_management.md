# Insurance General Account Management

## I. Executive Summary

**Insurance Companies** manage massive pools of capital (Float) to back their policy liabilities. The **General Account** is distinct from "Separate Accounts" (Unit-linked). The primary constraint is **Regulatory Capital** (Solvency II, RBC) and **Accounting Rules**. The portfolio is dominated by Investment Grade Credit to match the predictable, long-term liabilities, but typically hunts for yield in illiquid private credit to maintain spread.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Book Yield)
Insurers care about "Book Yield" (Accounting income).
Mark-to-Market volatility is ignored *if* assets are held to maturity (available for sale vs trading).
But credit impairments (defaults) hit capital immediately.

### Definition 2.2 (RBC Charge)
Risk-Based Capital.
Regulators assign "Capital Charge" to assets.
Treasuries: 0%.
Corp Bonds: Low.
Equities: Very High (30%+).
High charge $\implies$ Expensive to hold (drags ROE).
Insurers avoid Equities in the General Account.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Match Funding
Life Insurance: Long duration liabilities (Death 30 years out). Buy 30Y Corporates.
P&C (Property & Casualty): Short duration (Car crash next week). Buy 2Y Treasuries/Cash.
Mismatch risk: If interest rates rise, surrender rates might rise (Disintermediation).

### 3.2 Complexity Arbitrage
Regulators often tax distinct asset classes, not "risk."
"Regulatory Capital Arbitrage."
Securitization: Turn a pool of risky loans into an "A-rated" tranche.
Lower RBC charge, same economic risk.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Private Placements
Buying bonds directly from issuers (144A).
Illiquidity premium.
Covenants often stronger than public bonds.
Core holding for Life Insurers.

### 4.2 Bermuda Reinsurance
Offshore entities.
lighter capital rules? (Debatable, but "shadow insurance" allows more leverage/risk).
PE firms buying insurers to use the Float as permanent capital (Apollo / Athene model).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Convexity Risk):**
MBS in Insurance portfolio.
Rates drop $\implies$ Prepayments rise $\implies$ Duration shortens.
Liabilities remain long.
Asset-Liability mismatch opens up.
Need for hedging convexity.

**Exercise 2 (Inflation):**
P&C Claims inflation (Cost of car repair rises).
Liabilities rise.
Fixed Income assets stay flat.
Need inflation hedge (very hard for insurers due to capital charges).
