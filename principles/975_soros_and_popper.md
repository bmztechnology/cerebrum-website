# Soros and Popper Open Society

## I. Executive Summary

George Soros, influenced by Karl Popper, applied **Fallibilism** to Finance and Politics. **The Open Society** is one that recognizes it might be wrong (allows correction). **The Closed Society** (Totalitarian) claims absolute truth. In markets, **Reflexivity** (Feedback loops) prevents perfect knowledge. The synthesis links **Scientific Method** (Falsification) to **Risk Management** (Stop Losses).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Falsificationism)
Popper.
You cannot prove a theory true (Black Swan problem).
You can only prove it false.
Good Traders don't try to prove they are right.
They try to prove themselves wrong.
"What would kill my thesis?"
Confirmation Bias is the enemy of Popper.

### Definition 2.2 (The Open Society)
Institutions that allow peaceful correction of error.
Democracy (Vote out bad leaders).
Free Markets (Bankruptcy clears bad companies).
Free Speech (Criticism corrects bad ideas).
Soros Fund Management bet against Closed Societies (British Pound peg was a rigid lie).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Regime Change
Closed Societies eventually blow up (Information accumulation).
Soviet Union.
Currency Pegs.
Rigid systems lack negative feedback loops.
Soros strategy: Find the rigid lie. Bet on its collapse.
"The Soros Put."

### 3.2 Uncertainty Principle
Heisenberg / Soros.
Observer interferes with the observed.
Traders change the market.
Therefore, Equilibrium is impossible.
Permanent Flux.
"I am not a contrarian. I am a fallibilist."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Shorting Authority
Betting against Central Bank pegs.
Betting against "Corporate Fraud" (Enron).
Short Sellers are the immune system of the Open Society.
They expose lies.
Politicians hate them.

### 4.2 The Nazi Gold Train
Soros childhood survival.
"Assume the worst. Act fast."
Survival > Ideology.
Liquid assets.
The psychology of the refugee in Global Macro.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (China's Tech Crackdown):**
Closed Society asserting control over Open Markets (Alibaba).
Valuation crashed.
Markets need "Rule of Law" (Predictability).
Rule by Man (Xi) introduces unpriceable uncertainty.

**Exercise 2 (Stop Loss as Falsification):**
Stop loss at -10%.
"My hypothesis was: Price goes up. Reality says: Price down."
Accept falsification. Exit.
Holding a loser = Refusing to accept reality (Dogmatism).
