# Tokenomics Supply and Incentives

## I. Executive Summary

**Tokenomics** (Token Economics) is the design of monetary policy for crypto assets. It encompasses **Supply Schedules** (Inflation, Deflation, Burns), **Distribution** (Initial Allocation, Vesting), and **Utility** (Governance, Staking). Good tokenomics aligns incentives between Founders, Investors, and Users ("Flywheel"). Bad tokenomics leads to "Farm and Dump" spirals.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Inflation vs Deflation)
**Inflationary:** New tokens minted (Mining rewards, Staking yields). Dilutes holders unless demand grows. (e.g., Dogecoin).
**Deflationary:** Tokens removed from circulation (Burn mechanism). Increases scarcity. (e.g., ETH EIP-1559).
**Halving:** Bitcoin supply emission cuts in half every 4 years. Supply shock.

### Definition 2.2 (Vesting and Unlocks)
**Cliff:** Period where no tokens are released.
**Linear Vesting:** Tokens released gradually over time.
**Unlock Event:** Massive supply hits market. Prices usually drop.
Analyzing the "Emission Curve" is critical for valuation.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Velocity Problem
Utility Token (e.g., Payment coin).
$MV = PQ$.
If Velocity $V$ is high (Use and Sell instantly), value $M$ can be low even if usage $Q$ is high.
Investment tokens need "Sinks" (Staking, Lockups) to reduce Velocity.
"Token Sink" $\implies$ Price appreciation.

### 3.2 Ponzinomics (OHM)
Rebase tokens.
APY = 10,000%.
Paid in new tokens.
If Price stays constant, you get rich.
But Supply explosion $\implies$ hyperinflation $\implies$ Price collapse.
Game Theory: (3,3). If we all hold, we win. If one sells, we die. Nash Equilibrium is usually "Sell."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Vampire Attacks
SushiSwap vs Uniswap.
Sushi printed token to subsidize LPs to migrate liquidity.
"Yield Farming."
Using equity (Token) to buy usage (Liquidity).
Sustainable? Only if product is sticky.

### 4.2 Governance Value
Gov Tokens valueless?
No. If protocol earns fees, Gov token controls the treasury.
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) applied to Protocol Revenue.
"Real Yield" narrative.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Fully Diluted Valuation - FDV):**
Market Cap = Price $\times$ Circulating Supply.
FDV = Price $\times$ Total Supply.
Token A: Mcap \$10M. FDV \$1B. (1% unlocked).
Danger: 99% supply coming to dump on you.
Always check FDV.

**Exercise 2 (The Burn):**
Binance burns BNB quarterly based on profits.
Stock Buyback equivalent.
Reduces denominator.
Bullish.
