# Overconfidence Effect Illusion of Control

## I. Executive Summary

**Overconfidence** is the "Mother of all Biases." It creates a misalignment between subjective confidence and objective accuracy. In finance, it leads to **Excessive Trading**, **Under-Diversification**, and **Risk Underestimation**. Investors consistently overestimate their ability to predict markets and underestimate the role of luck (Randomness). The **Illusion of Control** amplifies this when outcomes appear linked to skill (e.g., getting lucky on a few trades).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Miscalibration)
Confidence Interval test.
"Give a 90% range for the S&P 500 return."
Result: Actual return falls outside the range 50% of the time, not 10%.
The confidence intervals are too narrow.
"Precision is not Accuracy."

### Definition 2.2 (The Better-Than-Average Effect)
80% of drivers think they are above average.
90% of active managers think they can beat the index.
Impossible statistically.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Self-Attribution Bias
Success $\implies$ "I am a genius" (Internal attribution).
Failure $\implies$ "The market was rigged / Bad luck" (External attribution).
Learning mechanism is broken. Egos grow, wisdom stays flat.

### 3.2 Volume and Returns
Odean (1998): "Boys will be Boys."
Overconfident investors trade more.
Trading friction (Commissions/Spreads) reduces net returns.
Most active traders have the worst performance.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Fem-Trading?
Studies show women trade less than men.
Women are less overconfident.
Women outperform men by approx 1% annually (Barber & Odean).
Testosterone linked to risk taking and overconfidence.

### 4.2 Probabilistic Thinking
Thinking in scenarios, not certainties.
"I am 60% sure roughly."
Ray Dalio / Bridgewater: Radical Transparency and verifying the "Believability" of the opinion holder.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Coin Toss):**
If you guess heads and it's heads.
Did you have skill?
Market behaves like a coin short term.
Traders confuse luck with skill constantly.

**Exercise 2 (Experts vs Algos):**
Experts (Fund Managers) often underperform simple linear models.
Expert intuition is noisy and overconfident.
Model consistency usually wins (Meehl).
