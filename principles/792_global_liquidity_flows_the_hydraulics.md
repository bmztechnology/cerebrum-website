# Global Liquidity Flows The Hydraulics

## I. Executive Summary

**Global Liquidity** is the aggregate supply of credit and money available for asset purchase. Combining **Central Bank Balance Sheets**, **FX Reserves**, and **Private Credit**, it acts as a hydraulic system lifting all asset classes. Assessing the **Net Liquidity Injection** (Fed + ECB + BOJ - TGA - RRP) is the primary predictor of macro-market direction.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Liquidity Formula)
(Howell / CrossBorder Capital).
$$ L_{Global} = CB_{Assets} + FX_{Reserves} - Gov_{Deposits} + Private_{Credit} $$
Correlates 0.85 with MSCI World Index.
"It's the flows, not the fundamentals."

### Definition 2.2 (Eurodollar System)
Offshore Dollars.
Not controlled by Fed.
Created by foreign banks lending USD.
Shadow money.
When Eurodollar pipes clog (Collateral shortage), Global Margin Call ensues.
DXY (Dollar Index) is the thermometer of this shortage.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Cantillon Effect
Money enters the system at specific points (Primary Dealers).
First receivers (Banks/Hedge Funds) buy assets at low prices.
Prices rise.
Last receivers (Wage earners) pay higher prices (Inflation).
Liquidity injections increase inequality and asset prices relative to wages.

### 3.2 Cross-Border Transmission
Carry Trade.
Borrow JPY (Cheap). Buy US Tech Stocks.
JPY weakens. Stocks rise.
Global Liquidity syncs everything.
"There is only one trade." (Risk On / Risk Off).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Tracking the TGA (Treasury General Account)
When Treasury spends TGA (writes checks), Cash enters system (Liquidity positive).
When Treasury refills TGA (issues bonds/collects tax), Cash leaves system (Liquidity negative).
Macro-Microstructure.

### 4.2 The Refinancing Wall
Corporate Debt maturity schedule.
Liquidity needed to roll over debt.
If Global Liquidity contracts when Wall hits $\implies$ Default Cycle.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Visualizing the Pump):**
Overlay Fed Balance Sheet vs S&P 500.
Divergences?
2020: Infinite correlation.
2022: Fed Tightening $\implies$ Bear Market.

**Exercise 2 (The Wrecking Ball):**
Rising USD.
Emerging Markets hold Dollar Debt.
Debt burden rises.
They sell Reserves (Treasuries) to defend currency.
Liquidity contraction.
USD acts as a wrecking ball for global risk.
