# Emerging Market Local Currency: FX Risk

## I. Executive Summary

**Local Currency Debt** eliminates the currency mismatch for the Sovereign (they can print the money to pay). However, it transfers the **FX Risk** and **Inflation Risk** to the investor. As EM local markets mature (GBI-EM Index), foreign ownership rises, creating a link between Global Risk Sentiment and Local Yield Curves.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Carry Trade)
Buy BRL Bond (10% Yield). Fund in USD (2% Cost).
Net Carry = 8%.
Risk: BRL spot devaluation.
If BRL drops > 8%, trade loses money.

### Definition 2.2 (Inflation Targeting)
Central Banks (Brazil, Mexico, Poland) adopted Credible Inflation Targeting.
Allows them to issue Long Term local fixed rate bonds.
Before credibility, could only issue Floating Rate (LFT) or Inflation Linked (NTN-B).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Curve Steepness
EM curves are usually steep.
Risk Premium for Inflation volatility.
Also, local pension funds prefer short duration? Or enforced by regulation.

### 3.2 Crowding Out
Heavy government issuance raises local rates ($r > g$).
Private sector cannot borrow.
Stifles growth.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Proxy Hedging
Invest in Equity (Long Brazil Stock).
Hedge with Short Currency (Sell BRL).
Or Hedge with Rates (Long BRL Rates / Short Bond).
Correlations break down in crisis.

### 4.2 Real Yields
EM often offers high Real Yields (Nominal 12% - Inflation 6% = 6% Real).
DM Real Yields often ~0% or negative.
Attracts structural capital.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Capital Controls):**
Risk that foreign investors cannot repatriate funds.
"Trapped Cash."
Index providers (MSCI/JPM) penalize countries with controls (Nigeria, Egypt).

**Exercise 2 (Index Inclusion):**
China/India inclusion in GBI-EM.
Forces Billions of passive flows into local bonds.
Yield compression.
