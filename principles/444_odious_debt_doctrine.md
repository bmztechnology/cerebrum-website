# Odious Debt Doctrine: Legal Theory

## I. Executive Summary

The **Odious Debt** doctrine is a legal theory arguing that sovereign debt incurred by a despotic regime for purposes contrary to the interests of the state (e.g., personal enrichment, suppression of the population) should **not be enforceable** against the successor democratic government. While morally compelling, it has rarely been successfully applied in international courts due to the threat it poses to market sanctity.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Sack Formula)
Alexander Nahum Sack (1927). 3 conditions:
1.  **Despotic Power:** Debt contracted without consent of people.
2.  **Odious Purpose:** Funds not used for benefit of people.
3.  **Creditor Awareness:** Creditor knew (1) and (2).

### Definition 2.2 (Clean Hands)
Creditors must do "Due Diligence" on use of proceeds.
If a bank lends to a dictator known to be buying weapons to crush a revolt, the debt is Odious.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Market Function
If Doctrine accepted: Banks would stop lending to Non-Democracies?
Or lending costs would spike (Risk Premium for Regime Change).
Good for democracy? Bad for stability?

### 3.2 Political Expediency
Iraq War (2003).
US argued Saddam's debt was odious to free the new Iraq government.
But US stopped short of establishing a legal precedent (fearing spillover to other allies).
Result: Paris Club granted 80% haircut "for economic reasons," avoiding the legal ruling.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Venezuela / PDVSA
Maduro regime issued "Hunger Bonds" (Goldman Sachs bought).
Opposition argues they were not approved by National Assembly.
Future restructuring might invoke Odious Debt / Illegitimacy.

### 4.2 ESG Screen
"Sovereign ESG."
Governance (G) score.
High corruption $\implies$ High risk of funds diversion $\implies$ High risk of future repudiation.
Pricing political legitimacy.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Succession of State):**
Standard International Law: Governments inherit the debts of predecessors.
Continuity of State.
Odious Debt is the exception to this rule.

**Exercise 2 (Ecuador 2008):**
Correa conducted "Debt Audit." declared debt "Illegitimate."
Defaulted.
Bought back bonds at 30 cents.
Market memory was short. Ecuador issued again in 2014.
