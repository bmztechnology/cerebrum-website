# Art Market Microstructure Auction vs Private

## I. Executive Summary

The **Art Market** is a dual system: the **Public Auction** (Christie's/Sotheby's) which provides price discovery and signaling, and the **Private Market** (Galleries/Dealers) which controls supply and curates the "Canon." Microstructure involves **Guarantees**, **Bidding Rings**, and the **Veblen Effect** (Higher Price $\implies$ Higher Demand). It is the ultimate market of **Information Asymmetry** and **Signaling**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Veblen Good)
Demand curve is upward sloping.
$Price \uparrow \implies \text{Status} \uparrow \implies Demand \uparrow$.
Price is the feature, not the bug.
"If it wasn't expensive, nobody would want it."

### Definition 2.2 (The Auction Guarantee)
Seller demands certainty.
Auction House finds a "Third Party Guarantor" (TPG).
TPG agrees to buy lot at Min Price.
If bidding goes higher, TPG gets a cut of the upside impact (Financing fee).
Microstructure: The TPG effectively has a "Call Option" on the art.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Signaling and Canonicalization
Why is a Basquiat worth \$100M?
Because a Gagosian Dealer sold it to a MoMA Trustee who donated it to the Museum.
The "Provenance Chain" validates the asset.
Private dealers maintain price stability by "Placing" art only with strong hands (who won't flip).
Auctions are "Liquidity Events" that test the Dealer's price curation.

### 3.2 Chandelier Bidding
Auctioneer mimics bids ("I have 20 million on the phone...").
Legally allowed up to the Reserve Price.
Creates illusion of demand.
Momentum Ignition for humans.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Burned Lot
If a lot fails to sell (Pass).
It is "Burned."
Value drops 30-50% instantly.
Signaling: "The market rejected this."
Strategic withdrawal: Better to withdraw the lot than risk roasting it.

### 4.2 Buying the Index
Mei Moses Art Indices.
Repeat Sales Regression (RSR).
Tracking the same painting selling in 1990 and 2010.
Alpha relative to S&P 500?
Low correlation. High transaction costs (25% Buyer's Premium).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The FreePort Trade):**
Buy Art in Geneva Freeport.

**Exercise 2 (Artist Arbitrage):**
Artist A is "Hot" (Zombie Formalism).
Prices spike 1000%.
Flippers enter.
Dealer loses control of supply.
