# Global Tactical Asset Allocation GTAA

## I. Executive Summary

**GTAA** moves beyond static weights (60/40) to **Dynamic Weights** based on **Valuation** and **Momentum**. It is the synthesis of Value (Buy what is cheap) and Trend (Buy what is moving). The strategy rotates capital to the most attractive asset classes monthly, aiming to capture upside while sidestepping severe drawdowns.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Ivy Portfolio - Meb Faber)
Start with 5 Asset Classes: US Stocks, Foreign Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities.
Rule: If Asset > 10 Month MA, Buy. Else, Cash.
Effect: You are never in a Bear Market for long.
You exit when the trend breaks.
Historical reduction in Drawdown: -50% $\to$ -15%.

### Definition 2.2 (Momentum + Value)
1. Rank assets by Value (CAPE Ratio). (Cheap stuff).
2. Filter for Momentum (Positive Trend). (Cheap stuff that is starting to work).
Avoids "Value Traps" (Cheap stuff going to zero).
Avoids "Momentum Crashes" (Expensive stuff popping).
The "Quantitative Value" approach.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Relative Strength
Comparing assets to each other.
"Is Gold beating S&P 500?"
Allocate to the winner.
"Dual Momentum" (Gary Antonacci).
1. Absolute Momentum: Is Asset > Cash? (Uptrend).
2. Relative Momentum: Is Asset > Other Assets? (Leader).
Buy the Leader, provided it is in an Uptrend.

### 3.2 Rotation Drag
Taxes and Transaction Costs.
Frequent rotation lowers returns.
In taxable accounts, GTAA is painful.
In tax-advantaged accounts (IRA), it is powerful.
ETF innovation allows internal rotation without tax events? (Creation/Redemption mechanic).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Cash Pivot
Most portfolios are fully invested.
GTAA allows going to 100% Cash.
"The safest position is the sidelines."
2008: GTAA signals went to Cash in early 2008. Saved 40%.
2022: GTAA signals went to Cash/Commodities. Saved 20%.

### 4.2 Factor Rotation
Applying GTAA to Factors.
Rotate between Value, Momentum, Quality, Low Vol.
"Factor Timing."
Hard to do (Factors are noisy).
But multi-factor diversificaiton works.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The False Signal):**
Price drops below MA. You sell.
Next day, Price jumps back above MA. You buy.
Loss.
Mitigation: Use "Regime Filters" or slower Moving Averages.
Avoid "Over-trading."

**Exercise 2 (Behavioral Alpha):**
GTAA is easy to backtest, hard to follow.
"Selling stocks when everyone is buying" (or vice versa).
Requires discipline.
The Alpha comes from the investor's ability to stick to the rules during noise.
