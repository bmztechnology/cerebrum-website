# IPO Underpricing and The Pop

## I. Executive Summary

**IPO Underpricing** is the systematic phenomenon where the Offer Price of a new listing is significantly lower than the First Day Closing Price (The "Pop"). On average, IPOs pop 15-20%. This implies "Money left on the table" for issuers. Theories for this inefficient transfer of wealth include **Prospect Theory** (Founders happy with combined wealth gain), **Winner's Curse** mitigation, and **Marketing buzz**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The IPO Pop)
$$ Return_{Initial} = \frac{P_{Close} - P_{Offer}}{P_{Offer}} $$
Dot-com bubble: Average pop > 60%.
Structurally, the Investment Bank (Underwriter) underprices to ensure "Book Building" success and favor institutional clients (spinning).

### Definition 2.2 (The Winner's Curse)
Uninformed investors only get allocated IPO shares when they are *bad* (Cold IPOs).
When IPO is *hot*, Informed Insiders take it all.
To keep Uninformed investors in the game, the average IPO must be underpriced to compensate for the "Lemons" they inadvertently buy.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Prospect Theory Application
Loughran and Ritter.
Issuer (Founder) sees two things:
1. Wealth gain from retained shares ($Millions).
2. Wealth loss from underpricing sold shares ($Thousands).
The massive gain (1) masks the pain of (2).
"Thaler's Mental Accounting": Founders don't complain because they are celebrating.

### 3.2 Information Revelation
Book Building process.
Bank asks investors "What will you pay?"
Investors only reveal high demand if they are rewarded with a discount.
Underpricing is the payment for truth-telling during price discovery.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Flipping
Institutions buy at Offer, sell at Close.
Risk-free Alpha?
Banks punish flippers (exclude from future IPOs).
"Laddering" (Illegal): Agreeing to buy more in aftermarket to boost price.

### 4.2 Direct Listing / SPACs
Direct Listing (Spotify): No new shares, no underwriter, market determined price. No Pop.
SPAC: Determining price via merger.
Attempts to solve the underpricing inefficiency.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Long Term Underperformance):**
Ritter.
IPOs pop on Day 1.
But underperform market over 3 years.
"Window of Opportunity": Issuers sell when sentiment is too high.
Don't hold IPOs long term.

**Exercise 2 (Allocator Access):**
Getting IPO allocation is the hardest game.
Retail gets nothing.
You must generate commissions for the bank to get the allocation.
"Pay to Play."
