# Carbon Trading Schemes: Pricing Pollution

## I. Executive Summary

**Carbon Markets** aim to internalize the externality of climate change by putting a price on $CO_2$. The mechanism is **Cap-and-Trade** (Compliance Market) or **Carbon Offsets** (Voluntary Market). The **EU ETS (Emissions Trading System)** is the largest and most liquid market. As the Cap shrinks (Net Zero targets), the price of allowances (EUA) must theoretically rise to the Marginal Abatement Cost of the industry.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cap-and-Trade)
Govt sets limit (Cap) on total emissions.
Issues Allowances (1 ton = 1 EUA).
Polluters must surrender allowances equal to emissions.
If you pollute less, you can sell excess allowances.
Price is market-determined.

### Definition 2.2 (CBAM - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism)
Carbon Tariff.
If EU firms pay for carbon ($80/ton) but Chinese firms don't.
EU industry dies (Carbon Leakage).
CBAM taxes Chinese imports based on their embedded carbon.
Forces the world to adopt carbon pricing to export to Europe.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Fuel Switching Price
Short term driver.
Cost to burn Coal + Carbon Tax vs Cost to burn Gas.
If Carbon Price is high, it pushes merit order from Coal to Gas.
If Gas is expensive (2022), Coal becomes profitable even with high Carbon Tax.

### 3.2 Validity of Offsets (Voluntary)
Planting trees (Nature Based Solutions).
Verification problem: "Additionality." (Would the forest have survived anyway?).
"Permanence." (What if the forest burns down?).
Verra/Gold Standard scandals. Voluntary Credits trade at massive discount to Compliance Credits.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long Carbon Thesis
The Cap decreases every year (Linear Reduction Factor).
Demand is sticky (Hard Polluters like Cement/Steel).
Squeeze is programmed by law.
KRBN ETF tracks Global Carbon.

### 4.2 Greenflation
Rising Carbon Price $\to$ Rising cost of Energy/Materials $\to$ CPI Inflation.
Central Banks cannot hike rates to fix Greenflation (it's structural supply side).
Stagflationary force.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Tesla):**
Tesla makes money selling Regulatory Credits (ZEV) to legacy automakers (Ford/GM).
For years, Tesla's profits came 100% from credits, not cars.
Carbon arbitrage.

**Exercise 2 (The 2022 Crash):**
Energy Crisis.
Europe fired up Coal plants to keep lights on.
Politicians intervened to flood market with Carbon allowances to keep price down (RePowerEU).
Political risk: If price gets too high, Govt changes the rules.
