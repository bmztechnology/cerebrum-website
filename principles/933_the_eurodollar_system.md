# The Eurodollar System Offshore Money

## I. Executive Summary

**Eurodollars** are US Dollars held in banks **outside the United States**. They are unregulated by the Federal Reserve (no reserve requirements). This **Offshore Money** system is actually larger than the domestic money supply. It is the engine of Global Trade and Credit. The synthesis reveals that the "Dollar" is not just a currency of the US, but a **Global Banking Protocol**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Ledger Money)
Eurodollars are not physical cash. They are entries on a bank ledger in London/Cayman.
Bank A (London) owes Bank B (Tokyo) \$10M.
Settlement occurs via Correspondent Banks in NYC (CHIPS).
If the Correspondent Bank freezes (Sanctions), the Eurodollar freezes.
Tiered system: Fed $\to$ Onshore Bank $\to$ Offshore Bank.

### Definition 2.2 (LIBOR / SOFR)
**LIBOR:** Price of unsecured Eurodollar lending. (Dead due to manipulation).
**SOFR:** Price of secured (Repo) Domestic lending.
The transition caused massive friction.
Eurodollars relied on Trust (Unsecured).
New system relies on Collateral (Secured).
Makes the global system "Hardware constrained" (Collateral scarcity).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Triffin Dilemma
To be the Global Reserve Currency, US must run Trade Deficits (export dollars).
Trade Deficits weaken the currency long-term.
Paradox.
Eurodollar market solves this by creating "Synthetic Dollars" via credit creation offshore.
Allows global liquidity without infinite US deficits?
Or creates infinite leverage?

### 3.2 The Dollar Milkshake Theory (Brent Johnson)
In a crisis, debts must be serviced in Dollars.
Global Debt > Global Dollar Supply.
Short Squeeze on the Dollar.
Everyone sells local currency to buy Dollars.
DXY spikes.
"Sucks the liquidity out of the rest of the world."
The Eurodollar shortage is the primary driver of EM crises.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Cross-Currency Basis Swap
Cost to swap Yen for Dollars.
Indicator of Eurodollar shortage.
If Basis is negative (e.g., -50bps), it means Dollars are scarce offshore.
Arbitrage opportunity: Borrow Dollars Onshore, Swap to Yen, Invest in JGBs?
No, usually the reverse: Borrow Yen, Swap to Dollars, buy Treasuries.
The "Global Dollar Funding Trade."

### 4.2 Exorbitant Privilege
US can sanction Russia by cutting off CHIPS access.
Weaponization of the Eurodollar system.
Acceleration of "De-Dollarization" attempts (BRICS).
But Network Effects of Eurodollar are massive (Credit network, not just payment network).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Birth of Eurodollars):**
Cold War. Soviets feared US would freeze their deposits in NYC.
Move deposits to London.
"Euro-bank" created.
Regulatory Arbitrage: Reg Q capped interest rates in US. London paid higher.
Capital fled to London.

**Exercise 2 (Credit Suisse Failure):**
Eurodollar bank run.
Outflows.
No "Lender of Last Resort" for Eurodollars?
Fed opened Swap Lines to Swiss National Bank.
Fed *is* the Global Central Bank.
