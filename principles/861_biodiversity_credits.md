# Biodiversity Credits Nature Repair

## I. Executive Summary

**Biodiversity Credits** (Biocredits) monetize the preservation of species and ecosystems, distinct from Carbon. The metric is not Tonnes of CO2, but **Hectares of Habitat** or **Species Abundance**. Microstructure challenges include the **Lack of Fungibility** (Save a Jaguar $\ne$ Save a Whale) and measurement complexity (eDNA).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Unit of Account)
What is 1 Unit?
"1 Hectare of preserved land with High Integrity?"
Wallace Token?
Method 1: Area x Condition.
Method 2: Uplift (Difference between Degraded and Restored).
Lack of standardization hinders liquidity.

### Definition 2.2 (Mitigation Hierarchy)
1. Avoid damage.
2. Minimize damage.
3. Restore damage.
4. Offset (Credit) remaining damage.
Regulators insist on 1-3. Credits are last resort.
Buying credits without doing 1-3 is "Greenwashing."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Measurement - eDNA
Environmental DNA.
Take water sample. Sequencer lists all DNA found.
"20 Fish species, 5 Frog species."
Verifiable data layer.
Replaces human surveyors walking in jungle.
Enables "Parametric Biodiversity?"

### 3.2 Stackability
Can you sell Carbon Credit AND Biodiversity Credit on the same forest?
**Stacking:** Yes. (Double revenue).
**Bundling:** No. (Sell one "Nature Credit" that includes both).
Debate: Does conserving the Tiger *add* value to the Carbon? Or is it the same action?
Additionality risks.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures)
Corporates must disclose nature risk.
Mining company destroys habitat.
Stock price hit.
Hedge: Buy Biodiversity Credits to secure "Social License to Operate."
Defensive asset.

### 4.2 The Jaguar Corridor
Colombia issues bond linked to Jaguar population.
If population stable, coupon drops?
Sovereign debt linked to nature KPI.
"Debt-for-Nature Swaps."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Location Specificity):**
Carbon is global (1 ton $CO_2$ in NY = 1 ton in Tokyo).
Biodiversity is local.
Destroying a wetland in Florida cannot be offset by saving a desert in Nevada.
Fragmentation of the market.
No "Global Price of Nature."

**Exercise 2 (Indigeneous Rights):**
80% of biodiversity is on Indigenous land.
Who gets the money?
"Biopiracy" risk.
Ethical sourcing required for premium pricing.
