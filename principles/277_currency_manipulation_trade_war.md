# Currency Manipulation Trade War: FX as Tariff

## I. Executive Summary

Tariffs and Exchange Rates are substitutes. A **10% Tariff** is economically equivalent to a **10% Currency Devaluation**. In Trade Wars, countries often offset tariffs by weakening their currency. This leads to a dangerous spiral of competitive depreciation and protectionism, destroying the global capital allocation mechanisms.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Offset)
US puts 25% Tariff on China ($P_{us}$ rises 25%).
China allows Yuan to fall 10% ($CNY/USD$ 6.3 $\to$ 7.0).
Net Price increase for US consumer $\approx$ 15%.
Tariff impact dampened.
"Weaponizing the Exchange Rate."

### Definition 2.2 (The Plaza Accord 1985)
US forced Japan/Germany to appreciate currencies.
Dollar Devaluation (Intervention).
Goal: Reduce US Trade Deficit.
Result: Japan Bubble (BoJ cut rates to offset Yen strength).
Exchange Rate fixing causes domestic asset bubbles.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Lerner Symmetry Theorem
A tax on Imports is equivalent to a tax on Exports.
Tariff appreciation Real Exchange Rate.
Price of exports rises.
Export sector dies.
Trump Tariffs $\to$ US Farmers suffered (Retaliation + Strong Dollar).

### 3.2 Countervailing Currency Intervention (CCI)
Proposal (Bergsten):
If China buys $1B USD to weaken Yuan.
US buys $1B CNY to strengthen Yuan.
Neutralize the flow.
"Mutually Assured Destruction" in FX markets.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The "Fixed" Line
China defends 7.00 USD/CNY.
Psychological level.
If Trade War heats up, China lets it break 7.00.
Market Panic.
"7.00 is the Tariff Thermometer."

### 4.2 Gold Response
Trade War $\to$ FX Volatility $\to$ Distrust in Fiat.
Gold rallies during Trade Wars.
Non-sovereign Store of Value.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Vietnam 2020):**
US Treasury labeled Vietnam manipulator.
Vietnam allowed Dong to appreciate slightly.
Avoided Tariffs.
Managed Float diplomacy.

**Exercise 2 (Smoot-Hawley + Gold Standard):**
In 1930s, countries couldn't devalue (Gold Standard).
So they used Tariffs.
Today we have Fiat. We use Devaluation.
Tariffs + Devaluation = Max Chaos.
