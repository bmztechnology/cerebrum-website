# Strategic Autonomy: The Industrial Pivot

## I. Executive Summary

**Strategic Autonomy** is the goal of nation-states to reduce dependence on rivals for critical survival inputs: Food, Energy, Technology, and Critical Minerals. It marks the shift from "Just-in-Time" efficiency to "Resilience" and "Sovereignty." It drives **Industrial Policy** (Subsidies, Tariffs) and protectionism, fundamentally altering the investment landscape for commodities and manufacturing.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Critical Minerals)
Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Rare Earths, Copper.
Essential for Green Transition (EVs, Wind) and Defense.
China processes 80%+.
West is rushing to build "Mine-to-Magnet" supply chains.

### Definition 2.2 (Food Security)
"Food is a weapon."
Russia/Ukraine = 30% of Global Wheat.
Export Bans (India Rice Ban 2023).
Fertilizer dependence (Potash).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Return of Industrial Policy
Govt picking winners.
IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) in US. ($370B subsidies).
Made in China 2025.
EU Green Deal.
Result: Subsidy Wars. WTO rules ignore.

### 3.2 Friend-Shoring
Sourcing only from allies.
"NATO Trade Bloc."
Creates higher costs but lower political risk.
Inflationary.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Commodity Supercycle
Underinvestment in mines for 10 years (ESG).
Now Demand Explosion (Strategic Autonomy).
Supply takes 10 years to come online.
Structural Bull Market for Copper/Lithium/Uranium.

### 4.2 National Champions
Invest in companies backed by the state.
Intel (US Fabs).
Albemarle (US Lithium).
Orano (French Uranium).
They cannot be allowed to fail.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Energy Independence):**
Europe realized relying on Russia for 40% of gas was suicide.
Pivot to US LNG and Renewables.
Cost: Trillions.
Result: Autonomy achieved (mostly) by 2024.

**Exercise 2 (The Battery Belt):**
US South (Georgia/Tennessee).
Massive investment in Battery Plants.
Driven by IRA subsidies.
Follow the Capex.
