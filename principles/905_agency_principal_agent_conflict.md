# Agency Principal Agent Conflict

## I. Executive Summary

**Agency Theory** explains why capitalism works (incentives) and why it fails (misaligned incentives). The **Principal** (Shareholder) hires the **Agent** (CEO/Manager) to maximize value. The Agent maximizes *their own utility* (Salary, Empire Building, Risk Avoidance or Risk Seeking). Every financial crisis is structurally an Agency Failure.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Agency Cost)
Loss of value due to divergence of interest.
Cost 1: Monitoring (Auditors, Board).
Cost 2: Bonding (Stock Options, Vesting).
Cost 3: Residual Loss (The private jet that didn't get cancelled).
The goal of Corporate Governance is to minimize Sum(Costs).

### Definition 2.2 (Moral Hazard)
Agent takes risk. Principal bears loss.
Bank CEO leverages 30:1.
If Win: Huge Bonus.
If Lose: Bailout (Taxpayer Principal).
Asymmetric Payoff $\implies$ Excessive Risk Taking.
"Privatizing Gains, Socializing Losses."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Skin in the Game
Nassim Taleb.
Hammurabi's Code: If builder builds a house that collapses and kills owner, builder is put to death.
Modern Finance: If Banker builds a CDO that collapses economy, Banker gets severance package.
Lack of Skin in the Game breaks the feedback loop of evolution.

### 3.2 Short-Termism (Career Risk)
"Average tenure of CEO = 5 years."
Incentive: Boost stock price *now* (Buybacks).
Ignore 10-year risks (Cyber, Climate, R&D).
"IBGYBG" (I'll Be Gone, You'll Be Gone).
Intergenerational agency conflict.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Founder Mode
Founder-led companies (Zuckerberg, Musk, Bezos).
Founder *is* the Principal (large ownership).
Alignment is high.
Allowed to take long-term risks (Metaverse).
Market often rewards Founder Control despite "Governance" complaints.
Evidence: Founders outperform Professional Managers.

### 4.2 The Carry Trade (Private Equity)
GP (General Partner) puts in 1%. LPs put in 99%.
GP gets 20% of profits.
GP Incentive: Swing for fences?
Actually, GP incentive is *raising the next fund*.
Behavior: Don't mark down assets (Volatility Laundering) to look stable and raise Fund IV.
Agency conflict in valuation.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Enron):**
Fastow (CFO) created SPVs to hide debt.
Paid himself management fees from SPVs.
Board waived Conflict of Interest code.
Total Agency Collapse.

**Exercise 2 (Clawbacks):**
SEC Rule 10D-1.
If company restates earnings due to error.
CEO must return bonus.
Alignment mechanism.
Does it work? Or do CEOs just demand higher base salary?
