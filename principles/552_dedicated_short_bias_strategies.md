# Dedicated Short Bias Strategies: Forensic Alpha

## I. Executive Summary

**Dedicated Short Bias** funds maintain a net short exposure to equities. Shorting is structurally difficult due to the **upward drift** of markets (Beta is positive), **Borrow Costs**, **Short Squeezes**, and **Asymmetric Payoffs** (Max gain 100%, Max loss Infinite). Therefore, Short Bias funds rely on **Forensic Accounting** (detecting fraud) and **Catalyst** identification to generate Alpha large enough to overcome the structural drag.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Drag)
Long: Return = Divs + Capital Gains.
Short: Return = Interest on Cash - Divs - Borrow Cost - Capital Gains.
Historically Market Drift $\approx$ 8-10%.
Short Manager starts the year -10% in the hole.

### Definition 2.2 (Short Squeeze)
Crowded Short ($>20\%$ of Float).
Price rises. Shorters get Margin Call. Must Buy to Cover.
Buying drives Price higher.
Loop.
(Example: GameStop 2021, Volkswagen 2008).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Forensic Alpha
Identifying:
-   Accounting Irregularities (Enron, Wirecard).
-   Channel Stuffing (Revenue recognition abuse).
-   Fraud / Ponzi schemes.
Activist Short Selling: Publish report, crash stock.
"Muddy Waters," "Hindenburg."

### 3.2 Portfolio Hedge
Short Bias funds are not meant to make money standalone long-term.
They are **Portfolio Insurance**.
If Long Portfolio -20%, Short Portfolio +40%.
Rebalance (Sell Short profits, Buy Longs).
Combined CAGR might be higher due to rebalancing bonus and drawdown reduction.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Put Options
Buying Puts vs Shorting Stock.
Puts: Defined risk. No borrow cost issues.
Cost: Decay (Theta).Implied Volatility premium.
Shorting: No Theta. Get the exact Delta $-1$.
Shorting is better for slow bleeds. Puts for crashes.

### 4.2 The "Head Fake"
Stock fraud often rallies 50% before collapsing.
"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
Position sizing is critical. Cap shorts at 2-3% of NAV.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (HTB - Hard to Borrow):**
Cost to borrow can be 50-100% APR.
"Negative Rebate."
Shorting implied return must be > 100%.
Only for terminal zeros.

**Exercise 2 (Index Shorting):**
Short SPY.
Low Borrow Cost.
No Squeeze risk?
But fighting the pure Beta drift of the economy.
Pure macro bet.
