# Nudging and Choice Architecture

## I. Executive Summary

**Nudging** (Thaler & Sunstein) involves designing the **Choice Architecture** to alter people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. In finance, nudges like "**Auto-Enrollment**" in 401ks have revolutionized savings rates. Regulators and platforms now use nudges to curb excessive trading or encourage diversification.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Libertarian Paternalism)
**Libertarian:** People should be free to do what they want (Freedom of choice).
**Paternalism:** Architects should influence people towards choices that make them better off (as judged by themselves).
The "Nudge" sits in the middle.

### Definition 2.2 (Defaults)
The most powerful nudge.
Opt-In vs Opt-Out.
Organ Donation rates: 15% (Opt-In) vs 99% (Opt-Out).
401k Partition: Defaulting into "Target Date Fund" vs "Cash."
"Path of least resistance."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Sludge
"Dark Nudges."
Friction designed to stop you from cancelling a subscription (e.g., "Call this number between 9-5").
In trading apps: "Are you sure you want to sell?" (Friction/Sludge used for good to prevent panic).
Confetti animations (Sludge used to encourage gambling).

### 3.2 Salience Nudges
Highlighting fees in red.
Showing risks in bold large font.
"Just-in-time education."
Informing the user exactly when the decision is made.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Save More Tomorrow (SMarT)
Benartzi & Thaler.
Ask employees to commit *future* raise to savings.
Bypasses Loss Aversion (Take home pay never drops).
Exploits Hyperbolic Discounting (Future self is virtuous).
Tripled savings rates.

### 4.2 Trading App Design
Robinhood vs Vanguard interfaces.
Robinhood: Default "Market Order" (Speed). Nudge $\to$ Trade.
Vanguard: Default "Limit Order" (Price). Nudge $\to$ Patience.
Interface is destiny.

## V. Exercises
