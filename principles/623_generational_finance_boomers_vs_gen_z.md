# Generational Finance Boomers vs Gen Z

## I. Executive Summary

**Generational Cohorts** share collective memories (Depression, Inflation, Tech Boom) that shape their financial worldview. **Baby Boomers** (Inflation scarred, Equities rich) drive current market valuations. **Millennials** (2008 scarred) are skeptical of banks. **Gen Z** (Digital natives) embraces gamified finance and crypto. Understanding **Intergenerational Wealth Transfer** and conflict is key to future macro trends.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cohort Effect)
Malmendier & Nagel.
Experiences experienced in early adulthood (18-25) determine lifetime risk tolerance.
Boomers: Experienced 1980s Bull Market. High Equity allocation.
Gen X/Millennials: Experienced 2000/2008 crashes. Lower Equity participation?

### Definition 2.2 (The Great Wealth Transfer)
\$68 Trillion moving from Boomers to Heirs.
Heirs invest differently.
Flows: From Mutual Funds $\to$ ETFs / Crypto / ESG.
From "Old Economy" $\to$ "New Economy."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Asset Meltdown Hypothesis
Boomers *must* sell stocks to fund retirement (Decumulation).
If Gen Z doesn't buy (low wages / student debt / preference shift), who buys?
Potential structural bear market in equities driven by demographics?
Or will Global buyers (China/India) replace Boomers?

### 3.2 The Financial Nihilism
Gen Z sentiment: "System is rigged. Housing is unaffordable."
Rational response: High variance betting (Crypto / Options).
"Get Rich or Die Trying."
Rejection of the "Slow compounding 60/40" path.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Housing Market
Boomers aging in place (Lock-in effect).
Shortage of inventory.
Millennials entering family formation years.
Demographic tailwind for Real Estate prices, headwinds for affordability.

### 4.2 Crypto Adoption
Demographic cliff.
$<5\%$ Boomer adoption.
$>50\%$ Gen Z adoption.
Betting on Crypto is betting on the mortality of the Dollar-based generation?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Inflation Hedging):**
Boomers buy Gold.
Gen Z buys Bitcoin.
Same need, different technology.

**Exercise 2 (Pension Crisis):**
Fewer workers per retiree (Dependency Ratio).
Social Security stress.
Generational contract breakage.
Political risk of "Gerontocracy" vs Youth.
