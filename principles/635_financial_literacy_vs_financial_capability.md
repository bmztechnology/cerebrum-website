# Financial Literacy vs Financial Capability

## I. Executive Summary

**Financial Literacy** (Knowledge: "Compound Interest") often fails to translate into **Financial Capability** (Behavior: "Actually Saving"). Studies show correlations between literacy and wealth are weaker than expected due to **Behavioral Gaps**. The industry is shifting focus from "Education" (Seminars) to "Just-in-Time Intervention" and **Automation** (changing the environment, not the person).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Big Three Questions)
Lusardi & Mitchell.
1. Interest Rate calculation.
2. Inflation impact.
3. Diversification (Single stock vs Fund).
Only 30% of adults get all 3 right.
Low literacy $\to$ High debt fee, sub-optimal portfolio.

### Definition 2.2 (The Knowing-Doing Gap)
Doctors smoke. Finance professors day trade.
Knowledge $\neq$ Behavior.
Bounded Self-Control prevents execution of known best practices.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Just-in-Time Education
Fernandes, Lynch, Netemeyer (2014).
"Decay of Knowledge."
Teaching Algebra in high school doesn't help with Mortgage calculation at age 30.
Teach Mortgage math *at the point of signing the mortgage*.
Contextual learning.

### 3.2 Index Card Advice
Pollack.
"Changes needed are simple."
Save 20%. Max 401k. Buy Index Funds. Pay off Credit Card.
Complexity is a product sold by the industry.
Capability is about executing the simple things consistently.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Workplace Wellness
Employers offering Financial coaches.
Stress reduction = Productivity gain.
"Auto-escalation" of savings.
Solving the behavior problem without the employee needing to learn MPT.

### 4.2 FinTech Solutions
"Acorns" (Round ups).
Bypassing the need for "Budgeting Discipline."
Automated micro-savings.
If you can't teach discipline, build a tool that mimics it.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Compound Interest Intuition):**
"Penny doubled every day for 30 days."
People guess \$1,000.
Answer: \$5 million.
Exponential growth is counter-intuitive to linear brains.
Literacy must bridge this gap.

**Exercise 2 (Rule of 72):**
Mental math heuristic.
Years to double = 72 / Rate.
Simple tools stick better than complex formulas.
