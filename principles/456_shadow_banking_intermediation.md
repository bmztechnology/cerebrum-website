# Shadow Banking Intermediation: Non Bank

## I. Executive Summary

**Shadow Banking** (Non-Bank Financial Intermediation - NBFI) performs the core banking function—**Credit Intermediation** and **Maturity Transformation**—without access to Central Bank liquidity or Deposit Insurance. Key Value Chain: **MMFs** (Depositors) $\to$ **Repo** (Funding) $\to$ **Securitization** (Assets) $\to$ **Hedge Funds/REITs** (Buyers). It increases efficiency but amplifies systemic leverage and run risk.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Maturity Transformation)
Borrow Short (Overnight Repo). Lend Long (MBS/Corporate Bonds).
Profit = Term Risk Premium + Credit Spread.
Risk: **Run on the Liabilities**.
Repo lenders refuse to roll over.
Fire sale of assets.

### Definition 2.2 (Collateral Chains)
Assets are re-used (rehypothecated).
Velocity of Collateral.
$Total \text{ } Credit = Base \text{ } Money \times Velocity$.
Shadow banking expands credit supply elasticity.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Hierarchy of Money
Perry Mehrling.
Money (Fed Reserves) > Safe Assets (Treasuries) > Deposits > Repo > CP.
In boom: Everything trades at Par (Moneyness).
In crisis: Hierarchy asserts itself. Lower tiers collapse.
Shadow banking creates "Safe Assets" (AAA MBS) from risky ones.
2008 was a run on these "Private Safe Assets."

### 3.2 Regulation
Dodd-Frank / Basel III tightened Banks.
Activity migrated to Shadow Banks (Private Credit, Mortgage REITs).
"Regulatory Arbitrage."
Risk moved from regulated to unregulated sector.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Private Credit
Direct Lending Funds (Blackstone, Apollo).
Take money from Insurance/Pensions (Locked up 10 years).
Lend to Corporates.
No "Run Risk" (because capital is locked).
Solution to the maturity mismatch problem?
Risk transferred to Illiquidity Risk for investors.

### 4.2 Stablecoins
Modern Shadow Banks.
USDC/Tether.
Assets: T-Bills/Repo. Liabilities: Demand Token.
Crypto MMFs.
Run risk demonstrated by Terra/UST and USDC depeg.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Margin Spirals):**
Asset Price Drop $\implies$ Haircut Increase $\implies$ Forced Deleveraging $\implies$ Asset Price Drop.
Pro-cyclical feedback loop.
Fed must become "Dealer of Last Resort."

**Exercise 2 (ETF Liquidity):**
Bond ETFs promise daily liquidity. Underlying bonds trade rarely.
Portfolio Rebalancing mechanism.
Authorized Participants act as the buffer.
Is this shadow banking? Yes, liquidity transformation.
