# Cultural Finance Home Bias

## I. Executive Summary

**Cultural Finance** studies how cultural norms (Religion, Language, Trust, Individualism) influence financial decisions. The most robust finding is **Home Bias**: the tendency to invest 80-90% of a portfolio in domestic assets, defying global diversification logic. Culture shapes risk tolerance, savings rates, and attitudes towards debt.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Home Bias Puzzle)
US represents 55% of Global Market Cap.
US investors hold 80% US stocks.
Japan represents 7% of Global Market Cap.
Japanese investors hold 70% Japanese stocks.
Explanation: Information asymmetry? Currency risk? Or pure Familiarity Heuristic (Culture)?

### Definition 2.2 (Hofstede Dimensions)
**Individualism:** High in US/UK (Stock market adoption high).
**Uncertainty Avoidance:** High in Germany/Japan (Cash/Bond preference).
Culture predicts asset allocation aggregates of nations.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Language and Future Savings
Chen (2013).
Languages with weak future-time reference (German, Chinese: "I go to school tomorrow") save more.
Languages with strong future grammar (English: "I *will* go to school") save less.
Language makes the future feel closer or further.

### 3.2 Religious Finance
Islamic Finance (Sharia).
Prohibition of Riba (Interest).
Result: Sukuk (Asset backed/Lease) structures instead of Bonds.
Cultural constraints drive financial engineering innovation.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Global Macro Marketing
Selling Mutual Funds in Germany vs USA.
Germany: Emphasize Safety, Solidity, History.
USA: Emphasize Growth, Beating the Market, Innovation.
Cultural framing.

### 4.2 Overcoming Home Bias
Forcing diversification via Global ETFs (ACWI).
Advisor role: "You already work in the US, own a home in the US. Your portfolio needs to be EX-US to hedge your human capital."
