# Sell in May Halloween Effect

## I. Executive Summary

**"Sell in May and Go Away"** (also known as the **Halloween Effect**) is the empirical observation that stock returns are significantly higher during the winter months (Nov-April) than the summer months (May-Oct). While initially dismissed as folklore, it has persisted across 37 countries and centuries of data, posing a challenge to the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Seasonal Return Gap)
$$ R_{winter} \gg R_{summer} $$
UK Data (1694-2000): "Sell in May" worked consistently.
US Data: Mean return May-Oct $\approx 1\%$. Mean return Nov-Apr $\approx 7\%$.
Effect is robust to outliers ( Crashes of 1929 and 1987 happened in Oct, reinforcing the summer risk).

### Definition 2.2 (SAD Hypothesis)
Seasonal Affective Disorder.
Kamstra, Kramer, Levi.
Shorter days $\implies$ Depression $\implies$ Risk Aversion.
Investors demand higher risk premium in Fall?
Or lowers risk taking in summer vacaction?

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Liquidity Cycles
Summer vacation "The Hamptons Effect."
Senior traders leave. Juniors man the desk.
Liquidity drops. Volatility risk rises?
Or Volume drops $\implies$ Prices drift?

### 3.2 The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
If everyone believes stocks fall in summer, they sell in May.
The selling causes the drop.
Behavioral coordination.
Arbitrage requires holding through the summer dead zone (Capital cost).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Sector Rotation
Summer: Defensive sectors (Utilities, Staples).
Winter: Cyclical sectors (Tech, Discretionary).
Capturing the Beta expansion in winter.

### 4.2 VIX Seasonality
VIX tends to rise in late summer / early autumn (Sept/Oct).
Buying Volatility in August as a hedge for the "October Effect."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Data Snooping?):**
Is it just randomness?
Out-of-sample tests in Emerging Markets confirm it.
Hard to explain with "Rational" Asset Pricing models (CAPM).

**Exercise 2 (Transaction Costs):**
Does the differential cover the tax/trading cost of switching?
In tax-deferred accounts (401k), Yes.
In taxable accounts, Capital Gains tax might wipe out the alpha.
