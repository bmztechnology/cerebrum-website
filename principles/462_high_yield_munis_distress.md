# High Yield Munis Distress: The Dirt

## I. Executive Summary

**High Yield (HY) Munis** are non-rated or junk-rated municipal bonds. Key sectors: **Tobacco Settlement Bonds**, **Senior Living/Nursing Homes**, **Charter Schools**, and **Land Secured (Dirt) Bonds**. It is an inefficient market dominated by specialist funds, offering equity-like returns for credit risk. Default rates are significantly higher than the broad Muni market.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Tobacco Bonds)
Backed by Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) payments from Big Tobacco.
payments depend on cigarette shipment volumes.
Secular decline in smoking ($3-4\%$ per year).
Bonds structured to withstand $5\%$ decline.
If decline accelerates (Vaping?), Bonds default.
"Turbo Redemptions": Excess cash pays down bonds early.

### Definition 2.2 (Dirt Bonds)
Mello-Roos / Special Assessment Districts.
Developer issues bonds to build roads/sewers for a new housing subdivision.
Tax is paid by the homeowners.
If Developer goes bust (homes not built/sold), bonds default.
Value $\approx$ Value of raw land.
"Loan to Dirt" ratio.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The 144A Market
Many HY Munis sold as 144A (Private Placement).
Limited liquidity.
Accredited Investors only.
Lack of disclosure.

### 3.2 Forbearance
Defaults in Munis are slow.
Nursing home misses payment.
Bondholders enter Forbearance Agreement (don't foreclose yet).
Try to find new operator.
Recovery takes years.
Recovery Rates often higher than Corporate Junk (Asset value usually remains).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Puerto Rico (The Big One)
\$70B default. Major HY index component.
Constitution "First Priority" clause tested.
Sales Tax (COFINA) vs GO.
Hedge funds (GoldenTree, Aurelius) litigated for years.
Outcome: Haircuts, new bonds, GDP warrants.

### 4.2 Project Finance Failures
Recycling Plants. Bio-fuel refineries.
"If you build it, garbage will come."
Technology risk disguised as Muni bond.
High default sector.
