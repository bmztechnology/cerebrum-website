# Rating Agencies: The Gatekeepers

## I. Executive Summary

**Credit Rating Agencies** (S&P, Moody's, Fitch) assess the creditworthiness of Sovereigns and Corporates. Their ratings (AAA to D) determine the **Cost of Capital** and eligibility for institutional portfolios. The "Investment Grade" (BBB-) threshold is the most critical line in finance. Falling below it ("Fallen Angel") triggers forced selling by pension funds, creating liquidity cascades.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Scale)
-   **Investment Grade (IG):** AAA, AA, A, BBB. (Safe, Low Yield).
-   **Speculative Grade (High Yield / Junk):** BB, B, CCC, CC, C. (Risky, High Yield).
-   **Default:** D.

### Definition 2.2 (Methodology)
Scorecard based on:
1.  **Institutional Strength:** Rule of law, political stability.
2.  **Economic Structure:** GDP/Capita, growth volatility.
3.  **External Finances:** Current Account, Reserves (Critical for EM).
4.  **Fiscal Flexibility:** Debt/GDP, Interest/Revenue.
5.  **Monetary Policy:** Independence, track record.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Pro-Cyclicality
Agencies tend to downgrade *after* the bad news is obvious.
They exacerbate the crisis.
Downgrade $\to$ Yields Rise $\to$ Service Cost Rises $\to$ More Solvency Risk $\to$ Downgrade.
"Self-Fulfilling Prophecy."

### 3.2 The Sovereign Ceiling
Usually, a company cannot be rated higher than its country.
If Brazil is Junk (BB), Petrobras is likely Junk (BB).
Exception: Companies with massive offshore revenue and cash (piercing the ceiling).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Trading the Upgrade/Downgrade
**Front-running:**
Predict the upgrade based on fundamentals (improving Reserves, falling Deficit).
Buy *before* the announcement.
When Moody's upgrades to IG: Massive passive inflows from Index Funds (IG inclusions).
Sell into the liquidity event.

### 4.2 The Fallen Angel Trade
Ford/GM downgraded to Junk.
Forced selling by IG-only funds. Price crashes below value.
Opportunistic Buying by High Yield funds.
Usually the "Bottom" of the price action.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (US Downgrade 2011):**
S&P downgraded US from AAA to AA+.
Panic?
Result: Treasury Yields FELL. (Chaos meant flight to safety, and Treasuries are still the safety, even if rated AA+).
Paradox.

**Exercise 2 (Inflation impact):**
Inflation improves Debt/GDP (Nominal GDP up).
Ratings might improve purely on math.
But Social Instability from inflation hurts "Institutional Strength" score.
Balance is tricky.
