# Systemic Risk in Non Banks Shadow Banking

## I. Executive Summary

**Systemic Risk** has migrated from Banks (2008) to **Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs)**: Pension Funds, Insurers, Hedge Funds, and CCPs. These entities are interconnected via **Derivatives**, **Repo**, and **Collateral Chains**. A failure in a Non-Bank (e.g., LDI Crisis, Archegos) can trigger a liquidity spiral that forces Central Banks to intervene, expanding the **Safety Net** implicitly.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Dash for Cash)
Crisis Mechanism:
1. Shock (COVID).
2. Non-Banks need Cash to meet Margin Calls (Derivatives).
3. Non-Banks sell liquid assets (Treasuries).
4. Market is overwhelmed. Treasury market breaks.
5. Fed buys Treasuries ("Market Maker of Last Resort").

### Definition 2.2 (Hidden Leverage)
Banks report leverage quarterly.
Hedge Funds (Archegos) use Total Return Swaps (TRS).
Leverage invisible to Prime Brokers (each PB sees only their slice).
Collapsed $\to$ \$10B loss for Banks (Credit Suisse).
Transparency gap in NBFIs.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Conveyor Belt of Risk
Risk originates in Real Economy.
Banks originate loans.
Securitize them (CLOs).
Sell to Insurers/Pension Funds.
Banks are safe (Middlemen).
Risk resides in the "Shadows" (Buy Side).
Is this better?
Yes: Buy Side doesn't take deposits.
No: Buy Side is connected to everything.

### 3.2 The liquidity Illusion
ETFs promise daily liquidity.
Underlying assets (High Yield Bonds) trade rarely.
In normal times, Authorized Participants (APs) arbitrage.
In crisis, APs step back.
ETF price disconnects from NAV.
Systemic run risk.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 CCP (Central Counterparty) Failure
The Ultimate Nightmare.
Derivatives mandated to clear through CCP.
Risk concentrated in one node (LCH, CME).
If a big member defaults and blows through the "Waterfall" (Default Fund).
Who bails out the CCP?
"Too Big to Fail" 2.0.

### 4.2 LDI Crisis (UK 2022)
Pension Funds used levered Gilts (Derivatives).
Rates rose. Margin Calls.
Pension Funds sold Gilts to pay margin.
Yields rose further. More Margin Calls.
Feedback Loop.
Bank of England intervened.
Showed that "Boring" pension funds can break the sovereign debt market.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Money Market Funds - MMF):**
2008: Reserve Primary Fund "Broke the Buck" (Lehman paper).
Run on MMFs.
Treasury guaranteed MMFs.
2020: Run on MMFs again.
Fed introduced MMLF (Liquidity Facility).
MMFs are shadow banks with implicit state guarantee.

**Exercise 2 (Step-in Risk):**
Bank sponsors a SIV (Structured Investment Vehicle).
Clean break?
SIV fails.
Reputational risk forces Bank to "Step in" and rescue SIV.
Risk comes back to the balance sheet.
