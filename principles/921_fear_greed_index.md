# The Fear and Greed Index

## I. Executive Summary

Sentiment must be quantified. The **Fear & Greed Index** (CNN) is a composite metric combining **Momentum**, **Breadth**, **Options**, **Junk Bond Demand**, **Volatility (VIX)**, and **Safe Haven Demand**. It acts as a contrarian oscillator. Extreme Fear (< 20) is a Buy signal. Extreme Greed (> 80) is a Sell signal.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The 7 Inputs)
1.  **Momentum:** S&P 500 vs 125-day MA.
2.  **Breadth:** Advancing vs Declining info.
3.  **Strength:** Net New Highs vs Lows.
4.  **Options:** Put/Call Ratio.
5.  **Junk Bond:** Yield Spread (Risk appetite).
6.  **Volatility:** VIX vs 50-day MA.
7.  **Safe Haven:** Asset returns (Stocks vs Bonds).

### Definition 2.2 (Oscillator Dynamics)
Mean Reverting.
Unlike Price (which can trend to infinity), Sentiment is bounded [0, 100].
Typical state: 40-60 (Neutral).
Time spent in extremes is short.
"Rubber Band" theory.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Sentiment as a Factor
Can you trade "Long Fear / Short Greed"?
Yes.
Systematic strategies fade extremes.
Rationale:
Extreme Fear $\implies$ Risk Premium is too high (Assets cheap).
Extreme Greed $\implies$ Risk Premium is too low (Assets expensive).
Arbitraging the Risk Premium.

### 3.2 Divergence
Price makes new High.
Fear & Greed makes Lower High.
Signal: The rally is narrowing.
Breadth is weakening. Options becoming protective.
Bearish Divergence. Precedes correction.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 VIX Term Structure
Contango (Normal): VIX Spot < VIX Future. Fear is low.
Backwardation (Panic): VIX Spot > VIX Future. Fear is high.
Fear & Greed incorporates this curve shape.
"The curve flattens before it inverts."

A "Condition" tool.
Condition: Extreme Greed.
Action: Tighten stops. Don't add leverage. Buy Puts.
