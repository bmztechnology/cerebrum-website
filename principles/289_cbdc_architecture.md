# CBDC Architecture: The Panopticon Ledger

## I. Executive Summary

**Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)** are digital liabilities of the Central Bank, replacing physical cash. They differ from Crypto (Decentralized) and Bank Deposits (Commercial Bank Liability). They offer instant settlement, programmable monetary policy, and financial inclusion. However, they introduce total state surveillance and the potential for **Negative Interest Rates** enforced on retail savers.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Two Tier Model)
-   **Central Bank:** Issues the token (Mint). Maintains the Ledger (or delegates).
-   **Commercial Bank:** Distributes the wallet (e.g., Chase App). Handles KYC/AML.
Prevents "Disintermediation" of banks.
If everyone moved deposits to Fed CBDC, Commercial Banks would lose funding $\to$ Credit Crunch.

### Definition 2.2 (Programmability)
Money with "If/Then" logic.
"This valid for Food only." (Food Stamps).
"This expires in 30 days." (Stimulus velocity).
"Interest Rate is -1% per day." (Forced spending).
Keynesian dream. Libertarian nightmare.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Wholesale vs Retail
-   **Wholesale (wCBDC):** Between Banks. Speeds up settlement (Atomic Settlement). Replaces RTGS. Uncontroversial. (Project mBridge).
-   **Retail (rCBDC):** For citizens. Replaces Cash. Highly controversial (Privacy/Freedom).

### 3.2 The Privacy Paradox
Central Banks say "We respect privacy."
But they also require "AML Compliance" (Anti-Money Laundering).
You cannot have Anonymity and Compliance simultaneously.
CBDC data *will* be visible to the state.
Ends the "Zone of Privacy" afforded by physical cash.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Avoiding the Digital Renminbi (e-CNY)
China is first mover.
e-CNY used for cross-border trade?
Bypasses SWIFT.
US Sanctions rely on SWIFT.
CBDC is a Geopolitical Tool to evade sanctions.

### 4.2 Banking Stocks
If CBDC is "Direct to Consumer" (FedAccounts).
Banks lose cheap deposit funding.
Cost of Capital rises.
Short Regional Banks.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Nigeria eNaira):**
Launched 2021.
Adoption < 0.5%.
People prefer Cash or Bitcoin/Stablecoins.
Trust in Central Bank is low.
Lesson: You can build it, but they might not come.

**Exercise 2 (Negative Rates Implementation):**
Physical Cash: Lower bound is 0% (Hold banknotes).
CBDC: Abolish banknotes.
Set rate to -5%.
No escape.
Perfect transmission of monetary policy.
