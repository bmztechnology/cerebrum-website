# Risk Per Trade: Universal Sizing Principle

## I. Golden Rule
Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

## II. Standard Guidelines
| Experience | Max Risk/Trade |
|------------|----------------|
| Beginner | 0.5-1% |
| Intermediate | 1-2% |
| Advanced | 2-3% |
| Never Exceed | 5% |

## III. Why 1-2%?
Allows ~50 consecutive losses before ruin.
Survivable losing streaks.

## IV. Calculation
$$Risk = Account \times Risk\%$$
$$PositionSize = \frac{Risk}{StopLoss \times PipValue}$$

## V. Adjusting Risk
Reduce after:
- Losing streak
- High drawdown
- Unfamiliar conditions

Increase (carefully) after:
- Proven edge
- Strong track record
- Deep understanding
