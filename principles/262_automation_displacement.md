# Automation Displacement: Robots vs Wages

## I. Executive Summary

**Automation** and **AI** replace labor with capital. Historically (Industrial Revolution), technology destroyed tasks but created new jobs (Luddite Fallacy). However, modern AI (LLMs) threatens "Cognitive Labor" (White Collar) for the first time. The fear is **Technological Unemployment** or extreme **Wage Polarization** (Hollowing out of the Middle Class).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Skill-Biased Technological Change - SBTC)
Tech benefits High Skill (Programmers) and replaces Middle Skill (Accountants/Factory).
Low Skill (Janitors/Nurses) are safe (Moravec's Paradox: Hard things are easy, easy things are hard for robots).
Result: U-Shaped Wage Curve. Inequality explodes.

### Definition 2.2 (Baumol's Cost Disease)
Sectors with high automation (Manufacturing) see prices fall.
Sectors with low automation (Education/Healthcare) see prices rise relative to CPI.
Why? Wages in stagnant sectors must rise to compete with productive sectors, but output doesn't rise.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Capital-Labor Substitution Elasticity ($\sigma$)
If $\sigma > 1$: Cheap Robots replace Humans. Labor Share of Income falls.
If $\sigma < 1$: Robots complement Humans. Humans get paid more.
AI suggests $\sigma > 1$ for many copy-writing/coding tasks.

### 3.2 The Productivity Paradox (Solow)
"You see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."
AI might finally break this paradox.
Generative AI boosts coding productivity by 50%+.
Deflationary Shock service sector.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Long Big Tech / Short BPO
Business Process Outsourcing (Call centers in Philippines/India).
AI agents replace Tier 1 support.
Existential threat to Emerging Market service exports.
Long Microsoft (Owner of the AI) / Short Teleperformance.

### 4.2 Universal Basic Income (UBI) Beta
If Labor Value $\to$ 0.
Demand collapses (Robots don't buy iPhones).
Govt MUST print money to sustain consumption (UBI).
MMT + Automation = Future Macro State.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Hollywood Strike 2023):**
Writers/Actors struck against AI digital replicas.
First major labor battle against Generative AI.
Labor Unions trying to ban efficiency.
Historically, limits on tech fail.

**Exercise 2 (Taxing Robots):**
Bill Gates proposal.
If Robot replaces worker, Robot should pay Income Tax.
To fund the displaced worker.
Execution difficulty: What is a robot? Is Excel a robot?
