# Biological Markets Evolutionary Finance

## I. Executive Summary

**Evolutionary Finance** treats markets as an ecosystem where **Strategies** are species. They compete for **Capital** (Food). Successful strategies reproduce (capital flows in); failed strategies go extinct (bankruptcy). The synthesis argues that the **Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH)** explains why "Anomalies" (Alpha) disappear: Predators evolve to eat them.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Red Queen Effect)
"It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."
In 1990, a simple Moving Average made money.
Today, HFT eats it.
You must run faster (better tech/data) just to maintain the *same* Alpha.
Evolutionary arms race.

### Definition 2.2 (Punctuated Equilibrium)
Evolution is not slow and steady.
It is long periods of stasis interrupted by sudden mass extinctions (Meteor).
Finance: Long periods of low vol (Great Moderation) interrupted by Crisis (2008).
Survival favors the **Generalist** (Cockroach) during the Meteor strike, and the **Specialist** (Dinosaur) during the boom.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Genetic Algorithms
Simulate evolution to find trading rules.
Generate 1000 random rules.
Test them. Keep top 10%.
Mutate/"Mate" them.
Repeat.
Result: Strategies that human programmers would never invent.
"Alien Logic."

### 3.2 Ecology of Alpha
Alpha is a resource.
Carrying Capacity.
If too many funds chase the same Value Factor, the Alpha decays to 0.
"Over-fishing."
Population crash (Quant Quake 2007).
Regrowth.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Biomimicry
Nature solves optimization problems well.
Ant Colony Optimization (Routing).
Swarm Intelligence.
Applying biological principles to organizational design.
"Decentralized, Autonomous, Resilient."

### 4.2 The Survival of the Fittest (Risk Manager)
Old traders say: "There are old traders and bold traders, but no old bold traders."
The market selects for **Risk Management**.
Reckless traders (High Variance) might win short term, but are culled long term.
Selection bias: The gurus you see are the survivors (Survivorship Bias).

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Invasive Species):**
HFT enters the ecosystem in 2000s.
Predator.
Changed the environment for everyone else (Market Makers).
Old species adapted or died (Floor Traders).

**Exercise 2 (Parasitism vs Mutualism):**
Hedge Funds = Parasites? (Extract fees).
Or Mutualists? (Provide liquidity / price discovery).
If the parasite kills the host (Economy), it dies too.
Financialization debates.
