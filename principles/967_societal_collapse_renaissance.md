# Societal Collapse vs Renaissance

## I. Executive Summary

History is cyclical. **Turchin’s Cliodynamics** (Secular Cycles) predicts instability in the 2020s due to **Elite Overproduction** and **Immiseration**. However, technology (AI/Energy) offers a path to **Renaissance** (Post-Scarcity). The markets are pricing a **Bifurcation**: either we crash into Feudalism/Chaos, or we ascend to a Star Trek economy. Volatility reflects this binary outcome.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Elite Overproduction)
Too many educated people fighting for too few elite positions.
Counter-elites emerge (Revolutionaries).
Lawyer glut $\implies$ Political polarization.
Historically precedes civil wars.

### Definition 2.2 (The Fourth Turning)
Strauss-Howe.
Generational Cycle (80 years).
High $\to$ Awakening $\to$ Unraveling $\to$ Crisis.
2008-2030 is the Crisis (Winter).
Old institutions destroyed. New ones built.
Reboot of the social contract.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Complexity Theory (Tainter)
Societies collapse when the *marginal return on complexity* becomes negative.
Adding a regulator/law costs more than it saves.
Simplification occurs via collapse.
Are we there? (Tax code length, Bureaucracy).
Crypto/AI as "Simplification Technologies"?

### 3.2 The Great Filter (Fermi Paradox)
Civilizations usually destroy themselves (Nukes/Bio/AI) before colonizing stars.
We are facing our Great Filter.
Existential Risk (X-Risk) pricing.
If $P(\text{Doom}) = 10\%$, Discount Rate should be infinite?
"Eat, drink, and be merry."

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Bunker Trade
NZ Land. Gold. Bitcoin. Guns.
Hedge against Collapse.
Insurance policy.

### 4.2 The Accelerationist Trade (e/acc)
Bet on Tech solving everything.
AI cures cancer, fusion solves energy, space solves resources.
Long Tech, Long Growth.
"Optimism is the only way to play the game."
If you bet on doom and win, you can't collect.
If you bet on boom and win, you get rich.
Asymmetric bet on Optimism.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Roaring 20s):**
1920s: Tech boom (Radio/Cars). Culture boom. Crash at end.
2020s: Tech boom (AI/Crypto).
Pattern matching.
Beware 2029?

**Exercise 2 (Institutional Decay):**
Trust in Congress/Media/Banks at all-time lows.
Low trust societies are poor.
Can trust be rebuilt?
Or must it be replaced by "Trustless" systems (Blockchains)?
