# RX Restructuring Investment Banking

## I. Executive Summary

**Restructuring (RX)** Investment Bankers (Houlihan Lokey, Lazard, PJT) advise companies or creditors in distress. Unlike M&A (Optimistic/Growth), RX is **Zero-Sum** (Fighting over a shrinking pie). Microstructure involves **Liability Management Exercises (LMEs)**, **Exchange Offers**, and **Valuation Fights** (Debtor wants Low Valuation to wipe out debt; Senior Creditor wants Low Valuation to wipe out Juniors; Junior wants High Valuation to stay in the money).

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Upton Tiering)
"Drop Down" transactions (J.Crew).
Move valuable assets (IP/Crown Jewels) into an Unrestricted Subsidiary to shield them from creditors.
Raise new debt against those assets.
"Stripping the collateral."
Creditor-on-Creditor violence.

### Definition 2.2 (Coercive Exchange)
Offer: "Exchange your Bond (Par) for New Bond (60 cents) with better covenants."
Threat: "If you don't exchange, we will strip the covenants from the Old Bond (Exit Consent)."
Result: Bondholders forced to exchange.
"Prisoner's Dilemma."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Valuation as a Weapon
**Enterprise Value (EV)** determines who gets paid.
Debtor Expert: "EV is \$500M." (Equity wiped out).
Equity Expert: "EV is \$1B." (Equity survives).
Battle of the DCF models.
Discount Rates, Terminal Multiples become litigation inputs.

### 3.2 The Retainer Game
Professionals demand retainers upfront.
"Evergreen Retainer."
Why? Bankruptcy estate might run out of cash.
Professionals must be "Disinterested."
Conflict checks are extensive.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Pre-Petition Strategy
Fix the balance sheet *before* Chapter 11.
Out-of-Court haircut.
Cheaper. Keeps stigma away (Vendor confidence).
But requires 90%+ participation (Holdout problem).

### 4.2 The "Texas Two-Step"
Divisive Merger.
Split company into GoodCo (Assets) and BadCo (Asbestos Liabilities).
BadCo files for bankruptcy.
GoodCo operates free.
Legal challenge: Fraudulent Conveyance?
J&J / LTL Management case.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Success Fees):**
RX Bankers paid huge "Restructuring Fee" upon emergence.

Even if the company re-files in 2 years ("Chapter 22").
Moral Hazard in advisory?

**Exercise 2 (Creditor Committees - UCC):**
