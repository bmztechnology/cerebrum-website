# Geoeconomics and War

## I. Executive Summary

**Geoeconomics** is the use of economic tools (Sanctions, Tariffs, Currency) to achieve geopolitical goals. The era of **Hyper-Globalization** is ending; **Fragmentation** (Friend-shoring) is beginning. Markets must price **Geopolitical Risk Premium** permanently. Finance is no longer neutral; it is a **Domain of Warfare**.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Thucydides Trap)
Rising Power (China) threatens Ruling Power (US).
War occurs 12 out of 16 times historically.
Economic Decoupling acts as the pre-war maneuvering.
Restrictions on Semiconductor exports (ASML) = Blockade logic.

### Definition 2.2 (The Weaponized Network)
USA controls SWIFT and the Dollar.
Weaponized against Iran, then Russia.
"Chokepoint Capitalism" applied to states.
Targeted nodes can be deleted from the global graph.
Incentivizes target to build parallel networks (CIPS, SPFS).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Democratic Peace Theory (Failed?)
Thesis: Democracies that trade with each other don't fight. (McDonald's Theory).
Reality: Russia invaded Ukraine despite gas trade (Nord Stream).
Interdependence did not prevent war; it just made it more expensive.
Markets mispriced this risk (Russian Stocks traded at 5x PE, which was "Cheap" until it went to 0).

### 3.2 Supply Chain Sovereignty
Efficiency (Just-in-Time) vs Resilience (Just-in-Case).
Resilience requires redundancy.
Inflationary.
National Security requires domestic production of Chips, Medicine, Energy.
Industrial Policy returns.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Investing in the Multipolar World
Portfolio A: Western Bloc (US, EU, JP).
Portfolio B: Global South/East (China, RU, BRICS).
Correlation between A and B drops.
Diversification benefit?
OR Capital Controls risk (Cannot get money out of B).
"Investable" vs "Uninvestable" markets.

### 4.2 Defense Stocks as ESG?
Ukraine War changed the narrative.
Defense protects Democracy.
EU Taxonomy debate.
Weapons stocks re-rated higher.
War is the ultimate "Social" issue?

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Taiwan Scenario):**
TSMC makes 90% of advanced chips.
Blockade/Invasion.
Global Tech Depression (-30% GDP?).
Priced in? No. (Apple trading at ATH).
The biggest Black Swan is a Grey Rhino (Obvious).

**Exercise 2 (Sanctions Compliance):**
Bank compliance costs explode.
"Is this transaction linked to a sanctioned oligarch's cousin?"
KYC becomes Geopolitical Intelligence.
