# Freeports and Tax Avoidance

## I. Executive Summary

**Freeports** (Geneva, Singapore, Delaware) are maximum-security warehouses located in special customs zones. Assets (Gold, Art, Cars) stored there are technically "in transit" and **suspend** VAT, Sales Tax, and Customs Duties. They act as **Liquidity Hubs** where assets trade ownership without physical movement, creating an offshore shadow market.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Suspensive Regime)
Goods enter Freeport.
import Duty suspended.
Sale occurs (A sells to B).
Capital Gains Tax applies? (Depends on Tax Residency of A/B).
VAT suspended.
Goods leave Freeport $\implies$ Taxes due.
Incentive: Keep goods in Freeport forever.

### Definition 2.2 (The Geneva King)
Yves Bouvier (Art Dealer / Freeport King).
Used information asymmetry of the Freeport to mark up prices to Rybolovlev.
"Transit" became "Storage."
Institutionalization of the black box.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Velocity of Money
Freeports increase velocity of high-end assets.
Friction of moving a Picasso: Shipping (\$50k) + Insurance (\$20k) + Customs delay.
Friction in Freeport: \$0 (Transfer Warehouse Receipt).
Liquidity $\uparrow$ due to reduced friction.

### 3.2 Regulatory Crackdown
EU forcing transparency in Freeports (2020).
Anti-Money Laundering (AML).
If you don't know who owns the stuff, it's a black hole.
Shift to "Home Storage" or less regulated zones (Dubai).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 The Delaware Loophole
USA does not sign CRS (Common Reporting Standard).
Delaware LLC owns the asset.
Asset in Geneva.
Beneficial Owner hidden.
The US is the world's biggest tax haven?

### 4.2 Storage Arbitrage
Cost of Storage in Geneva > Cost in Le Freeport (Luxembourg)?
Arb the rent.
But moving the asset triggers customs risk.
Assets are "Captive."

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Lost Leonardo):**
Salvator Mundi.
Stored in freeports for years.
Restored in secret.
Sold for \$450M.
The Freeport acted as a cocoon for value fabrication.

**Exercise 2 (Security Risk):**
Concentration Risk.
Billions of art in one building.
Fire / Theft / War.
Insurers limit exposure per location.
Capacity constraint on Freeports.
