# Comparative Advantage: Ricardo's Magic

## I. Executive Summary

**Comparative Advantage** (David Ricardo, 1817) is the most counter-intuitive yet powerful concept in economics. It proves that even if Country A is better at producing EVERYTHING than Country B (Absolute Advantage), both countries still benefit from trade if they specialize in what they are *relatively* best at. It is the mathematical foundation of Globalization.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Model)
-   **England:** Can produce 1 Cloth in 1 hour, 1 Wine in 2 hours.
-   **Portugal:** Can produce 1 Cloth in 2 hours, 1 Wine in 1 hour.
Clearly, England should make Cloth, Portugal Wine. Trade.
-   **Hard Case:**
-   **US:** 1 Chip (1hr), 1 Shirt (1hr).
-   **China:** 1 Chip (10hr), 1 Shirt (2hr).
US has Absolute Advantage in both.
But US opportunity cost of 1 Shirt is 1 Chip.
China opportunity cost of 1 Shirt is 0.2 Chips.
China has *Comparative Advantage* in Shirts.
US should make Chips, China Shirts. World output maximizes.

### Definition 2.2 (Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem)
Countries export goods that use their abundant factors intensively.
-   Capital Abundant (US) $\to$ Exports Planes (Capital intensive).
-   Labor Abundant (Vietnam) $\to$ Exports Textiles (Labor intensive).
Trade is essentially the exchange of Factors of Production.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Stolper-Samuelson Theorem
Opening trade raises the real return to the abundant factor and lowers the return to the scarce factor.
In US (Capital rich, Labor scarce):
Trade $\to$ Capital Owners get richer. Workers get poorer.
Explains rising inequality in developed world due to globalization.

### 3.2 Gains from Trade
Total Consumption Possibility Frontier (CPF) moves outward for both nations.
But internal distribution is not Pareto Optimal without redistribution (taxing winners to pay losers).

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Reshoring Limit
Can US bring back manufacturing?
Yes, but at the cost of massive efficiency loss.
If US makes Shirts (Sacrificing Chips), Global GDP falls.
Inflation rises.
"Autarky" (Self-sufficiency) is the path to poverty.

### 4.2 Emerging Market Alpha
Identify what factor a country has continuously.
India: Abundant cheap English-speaking High-IQ labor.
Comparative Advantage: IT Services / BPO.
Long Infosys.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Lawyer and the Secretary):**
Lawyer types 100 wpm (Words per minute). Secretary types 50 wpm.
Lawyer is better at typing.
Should Lawyer type their own notes?
No. Lawyer's opportunity cost is $500/hr. Secretary's is $20/hr.
Lawyer has Absolute Advantage in typing, but Comparative Disadvantage.

**Exercise 2 (Dutch Disease):**
Oil discovery makes country "Capital Abundant."
Destroys Comparative Advantage in Agriculture/Manufacturing.
The economy specializes too much.
