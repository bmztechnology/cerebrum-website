# Climate Finance Carbon Markets

## I. Executive Summary

**Climate Finance** directs capital towards assets that mitigate climate change (Renewables, Carbon Capture) or adapt to it. A key mechanism is **Carbon Pricing** via **Emissions Trading Systems (ETS)**. Carbon Credits transform pollution into a tradeable commodity, creating a market-based incentive to decarbonize. "Green Alpha" seeks to profit from the repricing of carbon risk.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Cap and Trade)
Regulator sets Cap (Total Tons of $CO_2$).
Allowances (EUA - European Union Allowances) auctioned.
Cap declines every year.
Scarcity $\implies$ Price rises $\implies$ Incentive to switch to clean tech.

### Definition 2.2 (Scope 1, 2, 3)
**Scope 1:** Direct emissions (Factory smoke).
**Scope 2:** Electricity purchased.
**Scope 3:** Supply chain and product usage (Hardest to measure).
Portfolios now measuring "Weighted Average Carbon Intensity" (WACI).

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Stranded Asset Hypothesis
If world hits Net Zero 2050 targets...
Oil reserves *cannot* be burned.
Oil companies are overvalued because their assets are worth zero.
Divestment movement reduces cost of capital for Green, raises it for Brown.

### 3.2 Social Cost of Carbon
Economic models (Nordhaus).
What is the cost of 1 ton of CO2 to society?
Current ETS price (approx €80/ton).
True cost? Estimates vary \$50 to \$200.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Carbon Arbitrage
Buying EU Carbon Futures (KRBN ETF).
Betting that political will forces price higher.
"Long Carbon" = "Short Pollution."

### 4.2 Green Bonds
Use of proceeds ring-fenced for green projects.
"Greenium" (Green Premium): Yield is slightly lower than equivalent brown bond.
Investors accept lower yield for impact mandate.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Additionality):**
Voluntary Carbon Markets (Offsets).
Investing in a forest involved "Additionality."
Would the trees have been planted anyway?
If yes, the credit is worthless.
Verification problems (Verra scandals).

**Exercise 2 (Transition Finance):**
Don't just buy Green (Wind).
Buy Brown (Coal utility) and finance its transition to Green.
Higher impact ("Delta Greenness").
