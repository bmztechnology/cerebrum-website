# Bounded Rationality Simon’s Scissors

## I. Executive Summary

**Bounded Rationality** (Herbert Simon) challenges the economic assumption of the "Homo Economicus" (perfect optimizer). It states that rationality is limited by **Information**, **Cognitive Capacity**, and **Time**. Humans do not optimize; they **Satisfice** (search until a "good enough" solution is found). In markets, this explains why investors use simple P/E ratios instead of complex DCF models: the cost of full rationality is too high.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Simon's Scissors)
Human behavior is shaped by two blades:
1.  **Cognitive Limitations:** The brain's processing power.
2.  **Environmental Structure:** The complexity of the market.
Rationality is the fit between the two.
Heuristics are rational *given* the constraints.

### Definition 2.2 (Computational Complexity)
Calculating the "Optimal" portfolio (Markowitz) for 5000 stocks requires equating $5000^2$ covariance terms.
Impossible for a human brain.
"Equal Weighting" (1/N) is a boundedly rational response.

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 Fast and Frugal Trees
Gigerenzer.
Simple decision rules often outperform complex regressions out-of-sample.
Rule: "If Sector = Tech AND Trend = Up, Buy."
Robustness to noise.
Ignoring information can be better than using everything (Overfitting).

### 3.2 Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH)
Andrew Lo.
Evolutionary efficiency.
Agents use heuristics that worked in the past environment.
When environment changes (e.g., High Rates), old heuristics fail.
Bounded rationality adapts slowly.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Information Overload
Too much data degrades decision quality.
"Analysis Paralysis."
Strategic Ignore: Filters.
Trading only on Closing Price (ignoring intraday noise).

### 4.2 Local Search
Investors buy stocks they know (Home Bias).
Searching the global universe is too costly.
"Invest in what you know" (Lynch) is an admission of bounded rationality.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (The Recognition Heuristic):**
Which city is bigger: San Diego or San Antonio?
Germans get it right more than Americans.
Rule: "If I've heard of it, it's bigger."
In stocks: "If I've heard of the brand, buy the stock." (Works surprisingly well).

**Exercise 2 (Satisficing Exit):**
Sell when gain > 20%.
Is it optimal? Maybe stock goes to +50%.
But calculating the peak is impossible.
20% is "Good Enough."
