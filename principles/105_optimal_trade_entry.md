# Optimal Trade Entry (OTE): Fibonacci Entry

## I. Definition
Entry zone between 62-79% Fibonacci retracement.

## II. Calculation
Draw Fib from swing low to high (or vice versa).
OTE zone = 61.8% to 78.6% level.

## III. Why OTE Works
- Deep enough for good R:R
- Not too deep to catch reversals
- Institutional accumulation zone

## IV. Entry Method
Wait for price to enter OTE zone.
Look for confirmation (candle pattern, lower TF structure).

## V. Stop Placement
Below swing used for Fib (beyond 100%).

## VI. Target
- Swing high (conservative)
- -27.2% extension (moderate)
- -61.8% extension (aggressive)
