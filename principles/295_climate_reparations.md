# Climate Reparations: The North-South Divide

## I. Executive Summary

**Climate Reparations** (Loss and Damage Fund) argues that the Global North (Historical Emitters) owes the Global South (Victims) for climate change damages. Strategically, this is evolving into financial transfers and **Carbon Protectionism**. Mechanisms like the EU's **CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism)** act as green tariffs, forcing the South to decarbonize or lose market access.

## II. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (The Carbon Budget)
Total CO2 allowed for 1.5C warming.
North used 80% of it to get rich.
South says: "New Colonialism." limiting our growth.
Demand: "Common But Differentiated Responsibilities."

### Definition 2.2 (CBAM - Green Tariff)
EU imposes carbon price (€100/ton).
Imports from India (Dirty Steel) pay the difference.
Prevents "Carbon Leakage."
India calls it protectionism.
Result: Bifurcation of trade into "Green Bloc" and "Dirty Bloc."

## III. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1 The Discount Rate Debate (Stern Review)
How much do we value the future?
High Discount Rate: Do nothing (Future is cheap).
Low Discount Rate: Act now (Future is precious).
Reparations imply a Negative Discount Rate (Past creates debt today).

### 3.2 Debt-for-Nature Swaps
Ecuador owes debt.
Creditors write off 50% IF Ecuador protects the Galapagos.
Financializing Nature.
Sovereign Debt restructuring tool.

## IV. Strategic Applications

### 4.1 Transition Metals Supercycle
Global South holds the Copper, Cobalt, Lithium.
"OPEC of Minerals."
Indonesia banned Nickel ore exports to force domestic processing.
Resource Nationalism driven by Climate demand.

### 4.2 Insurance Collapse
Re-insurers (Swiss Re) pulling out of Florida/California.
"Uninsurable markets."
State must step in (Socialization of Risk).
Fiscal Black Hole.

## V. Exercises

**Exercise 1 (Pakistan Floods 2022):**
$30B damage.
Pakistan emits < 1% of global CO2.
Demanded reparations at COP27.
Won a "Fund" (Empty bucket so far).
Moral Hazard?

**Exercise 2 (Scope 3 Emissions):**
Companies responsible for supply chain emissions.
Apple forcing suppliers in Vietnam to go Solar.
Corporate imperialism? Or stewardship?
Forces Capex down the chain.
