# Forex Trading Principles

Technical analysis and trading concepts used in Cerebrum Forex.

## Technical Indicators

### Trend Indicators

**Moving Averages (MA)**
- SMA (Simple Moving Average): Average of last N prices
- EMA (Exponential Moving Average): Weighted average, more recent = higher weight
- Crossovers: Short MA crossing above long MA = bullish signal

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
- MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)
- Signal Line = EMA(9) of MACD
- Histogram = MACD - Signal
- Bullish: MACD crosses above Signal

**ADX (Average Directional Index)**
- Measures trend strength (0-100)
- ADX > 25 = strong trend
- ADX < 20 = weak/no trend

**Ichimoku Cloud**
- Tenkan-sen (Conversion): (High9 + Low9) / 2
- Kijun-sen (Base): (High26 + Low26) / 2
- Senkou A: (Tenkan + Kijun) / 2
- Senkou B: (High52 + Low52) / 2
- Price above cloud = bullish

### Momentum Indicators

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
- Range: 0-100
- RSI > 70 = overbought (potential sell)
- RSI < 30 = oversold (potential buy)

**Stochastic Oscillator**
- %K = (Close - Low14) / (High14 - Low14) × 100
- %D = SMA(3) of %K
- Overbought > 80, Oversold < 20

**Williams %R**
- Range: -100 to 0
- Similar to Stochastic but inverted

---

### Volatility Indicators

**ATR (Average True Range)**
- Measures market volatility
- True Range = max(High-Low, |High-PrevClose|, |Low-PrevClose|)
- ATR = SMA(14) of True Range

**Bollinger Bands**
- Middle = SMA(20)
- Upper = SMA(20) + 2×STD(20)
- Lower = SMA(20) - 2×STD(20)
- Width indicates volatility

## Signal Logic

### Consensus Voting

Cerebrum uses 3 models: XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM

**Rule: 2 out of 3 models must agree**

| XGBoost | LightGBM | LSTM | Final Signal |
|---------|----------|------|--------------|
| BUY     | BUY      | SELL | BUY          |
| SELL    | SELL     | BUY  | SELL         |
| BUY     | SELL     | NEUTRAL | NEUTRAL   |

### Confidence Calculation

```
Confidence = Average of agreeing models' confidence scores
```

## Forex Math

### Pip Value
- EUR/USD: 1 pip = 0.0001
- Pip value = (Pip × Lot Size) / Exchange Rate

### Risk Management
- Risk per trade: 1-2% of account
- Position Size = (Account × Risk%) / (SL pips × Pip Value)

### Profit/Loss
- P/L = (Close - Open) × Lot Size × Pip Value
