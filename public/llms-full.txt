# Cerebrum Forex - Detailed Technical Overview

## 1. Introduction
Cerebrum Forex is an algorithmic trading system designed for the EUR/USD currency pair. Unlike traditional indicators (RSI, MACD), it relies on supervised machine learning to detect non-linear patterns in price action.

## 2. Architecture
### 2.1 The Core (Python)
- **Data Ingestion**: Pulls OHLCV data from MT5 terminal via `MetaTrader5` python package.
- **Feature Engineering**: Calculates over 50 technical features (Moving Averages, Volatility, Momentum).
- **Inference**: Runs 5 optimized models in parallel.
- **Voting System**: A "Congress" engine aggregates weighted votes from all models to produce a final signal.

### 2.2 The Interface (PyQt6)
- **Dashboard**: Visualizes live market status, current signal, and account metrics.
- **Training Tab**: Allows users to extract historical data and retrain models.
- **Settings**: Configurable risk thresholds, notification preferences, and prop firm rules.

### 2.3 The Expert Advisor (MQL5)
- Acts as a bridge between the Python application and the MT5 terminal.
- Receives trade commands (Open Order, Close Position, Modify SL/TP).
- Sends account info (Balance, Equity) back to the GUI.

## 3. Usage Workflow
1. **Launch**: Open MT5 and Cerebrum Forex. Connection is automatic.
2. **Scan**: The AI continuously scans enabled timeframes (default: M15, H1).
3. **Signal**: When confidence > threshold (e.g., 70%), a signal is generated.
4. **Action**: 
   - **Auto Mode**: The EA executes the trade with pre-defined Risk/Reward.
   - **Manual Mode**: User receives a desktop/email alert and confirms execution.
